# Canvas-Motion-API
## Disclaimer
This is my first time ever using a REST API for any service.

This is also my first tame using python in an object oriented way.

This project is really fun for me because I am learning, but it is not in any way competent.

The commits for this project will look like a nightmare because I work between a desktop and laptop from when I'm at home or when I'm in between classes.

I am prideful in my adventure to learn something new, but not in the quality of the product that is this project as it stands currently.
