Purpose 
--------

When looking at a situation out in the world it can feel like what we are looking at is just a haphazard collection of objects. The purpose of this assignment is to practice getting in the mindset of thinking about a situation in terms of how things can be grouped together, what's relevant, and what aspects of those things and their interactions are important to us.

---------
Your Task

---------

Your task is to analyze the scene depicted in the attached picture (from the Where's Waldo series) and answer some questions about it as detailed in the specifications below.

Description:
--------
Purpose 
--------

In this individual assignment, you will demonstrate how to use a SQL script to write more advanced SQL SELECT queries to retrieve information from the band database similar to the one you created in team assignment 3.2.

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

-----
Task 
-----

Your task is to create a single .sql script that contains the SQL queries that produce the output for the following 5 questions.

* Download this script: [assignment41.sql.] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383819?wrap=1)

* IMPORTANT NOTE: This script will create a new set of tables and a new dataset compared to your submission for the previous assignment. Don't worry: we will still be able to grade Assignment 3.2 by running the script that you turned in. However, if for any reason you have not submitted assignment 3.2, consult with your instructor.

* After reading the queries that you need to write, you may need to edit the INSERT statements in the script as necessary to ensure you have adequate data.

* Add the SELECT queries for this assignment to the end of the script.

* Run your copy of the script in your individual MySQL database.

Do not hard code! In other words, do not use specific IDs in your WHERE instead of writing a query that works for any data added that might be added to the tables. Don't just look at the data, figure out the answer and then print that specific name or ID

Whenever you're asked for an artist's full name, combine the parts of their name into one value  - i.e. if fname = "Jane" and lname = "Doe", return "Jane Doe".

Question 1
----------

For each artist who is currently in a band and is under 30 years old: *

Return the artist’s full name, gender, date of birth (formatted like  "06/12/2019"), and the name of the band they are in with date joined formatted like "July 18, 2022".

Order the results by artist name

* You will not get full points if you just say something like DOB > '1992-03-23' (hard coded thirty years ago today). The query would not age well!

Question 2
----------

For all artists who are currently in a band:

Return the artist’s full name (as a single value), the band name, and how long in years the artist has been in the band. The artist should only be shown once for each band.

(Hint: Remember that the data might include an artist who left a band and then rejoined. That is the challenge here!)

Question 3
----------

For each band that currently has a female member:

Return the name of the band and each artist's full name (as a single value).

Order by band name and artist name.

Comment: It is fairly easy to write a query that returns just the female members who are currently in bands (12 rows); doing this correctly will earn you the 7 points for this question. However, the question is really asking for all current members of bands that currently have a female member (20 rows); I don't believe that can be done without a subquery, so if you do some research and figure out how to do the subquery, you can earn 2 bonus points.

Question 4
----------

Find the album title, band name, format, and total length of all albums released since January 1, 2000.

Order from longest to shortest.

Try to return the format as the word "single" or "double" rather than just the stored value "s" or "d". (Google 'mySQL IF() function'.)

Try to get the total length to look like a reasonable time value rather than just a big number. This is hard! Google "summing time values in MySQL".

Question 5
----------

For all bands:

Return how many artists are currently in the band, how many artists have ever been in the band (be careful not to count the same artists multiple times if they've left and rejoined) and the number of albums the band has made. This is tricky! There are a number of ways you can approach this.

Order by band from A-Z.

-------------------------
Submitting the Assignment
-------------------------

This is an individual assignment. Submit a single assignment41.sql script on Canvas. This should include all the DROP TABLE, CREATE, INSERT, and SELECT statements so that the graders can run it in their own database.

Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

Late submissions will be accepted subject to the standard course policy. Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

--------------
Grading Rubric

--------------

This assignment will be graded on the following basis:

* The assignment is turned in as a single .sql script that runs without errors. (15 points)

* Each question is worth 7 points. If the query runs in MYSQL without errors, you will get 3 points. If the query accomplishes what is asked, you will get the additional 4 points for that query.

--------
Purpose 
--------

You have been hired to manage the database for the Fish 'n' Pickles Restaurant. The manager, Durant Pumfrey, hopes to use your expertise to get some information that will help him plan next year’s menu (Questions 1, 2, and 3). Durant is also concerned about rumors of employees misbehaving when no manager is on duty to supervise them (Questions 4 and 5). Database professionals frequently have to come up with such "ad hoc" queries to answer questions as they arise

This is a team assignment, but you will be working in the large dataset account (i308_dataset) with the big database.

In the Task section we will show the questions you are asked to solve and also will show the results from the system that you should get.  For full credit, please confirm your results are exactly the same as what is shown.

This module aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

------
 Task 
------

Your team task is to create a single .sql script that contains just the SQL SELECT queries that produce the output for the following 5 questions.

Question 1
----------

"We are trying to reduce menu items, so we are looking for poor sales. Please show me the item name, item price, and number sold in year 2013, but limit it to only ten items and list them in order of least number sold."

Your results should match this exactly:

[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 11.52.23 AM.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383854/preview)

 Question 2

“Hmm... We probably should look at the total sales price. Please add (to the first query) the total sales for the items and order by the lowest 10 total sales. Let's see totals for 2013 and 2014."

Hint: This query can be written by making additions and/or minor changes to Question 1.

Your results should match this exactly:

[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 11.55.40 AM.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383859/preview)

Question 3
----------

"I want compare the years 2011 and 2012 month by month to see what time of year is most profitable.”

Hint: This query requires some Googling to get the formats and sorting order exactly right.

Your results should match this exactly:

[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 12.03.54 PM.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383866/preview)

Question 4
----------

“Now let's look at staffing. For each day of the week during 2003, 2004, and 2005, how many staff (total) were working when no one was working in the manager role?"

Hint: You will need to use a subquery. The subquery will find the days when a manager was working, and the main query will return data about the days not returned by the subquery.

Your results should match this exactly:

[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 12.04.41 PM.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383885/preview)

Important Note: There are two different ways to write this that give different results. It turns out that the data is actually not consistent! Use the date in the emp_shift table rather than the day_of_week value in the shift table.

Question 5
----------

“Based upon question 4, show the full names, role, and date of any employees working on a day when no manager was on duty but at least 2 people were working in the years 2010 and 2011.”

Hint: This final query is challenging. It involves an extra level of subquery. You can adapt the answer to Question 4 as the top-level subquery.

Your results should match this exactly:

Purpose 
--------

The purpose of this assignment is to practice creating web-based front ends in PHP to safely expose data from our bands database.

This activity aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

6. Create a Web-Based Portal For Interacting With Data

------
 Task 
------

Part One (20 points)

Step 1: Create a web page animals.html that has the following input elements:

* A text box for a user name.

* A set of radio buttons for "the animal you are most afraid of" with four suitable choices.

* A dropdown for "your favorite animal" that offers four suitable choices. (Use w3schools to figure out how to set up this input type.)

* A "Proceed" button. When it is clicked the animals.php script should run.

Step 2: Create a PHP script animals.php that gives the inputs back to the user on a new page in a suitable format.

4 of the 20 points available will be based on making your web page(s) look "nice".

Part Two (30 points)

Your task is to create a web-based front end for an INSERT query for the Artist table in the artist/band database in your individual account. If necessary, re-run the script provided for Assignment 8 to make sure your tables are correctly set up.

Refer to [EXAMPLE | Creating the Bands HTML and PHP Pages] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/pages/example-%7C-creating-the-bands-html-and-php-pages) as a model for this process.

Step 0: Download this script and run it in your individual database (0 points)  [Assignment51.sql] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383823?wrap=1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Create the artist.html file (10 points)
-----------------------------------------------

* The artist.html page should contain a form that will allow the user to add new data to the artist table.

* Make sure you correctly set the action attribute on your form to insertartist.php

Step 2: Create the insertartist.php file (15 points)
----------------------------------------------------

* Create the insertartist.php file that takes the data from the artist.html form, connects to the database, and successfully inserts the data into the artist table. A message should be displayed to confirm that the record has been added.

Step 3: Confirm Results in MySQL (5) points)
--------------------------------------------

* Log into your MySql account and write a simple select query that proves that your new record has been added to the artist table. Take a screenshot of the output.

--------------------------
Submitting Your Assignment
--------------------------

This is an individual assignment. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment. All work must be your own.

Submit the following on Canvas:

* A text or pdf file with the full URLs to all files created for this assignment

* Your full code for the following files:

* animals.html

* animals.php

* artist.html

* insertartist.php

* A .jpg or .png file containing the screen shot from Step 3.

Make sure that you submit the Artist files, not the Band files that you were given in the example. It should be fairly simple to create the Artist files based on the Band example. You will be asked to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score if you submit the Band example.

Once you have submitted, check that your documents open correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

---------
 Purpose 
---------

The purpose of this assignment is for your team to practice creating web-based front ends in PHP for the Artist/Band database.

This activity aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

6. Create a Web-Based Portal For Interacting With Data

Additionally, this assignment will help you a lot in getting your project onto the Web!

------
 Task 
------

Your team task is to create a web-based front end that provides information about a Band in an attractive format.

Step 0: Run the [Assignment52.sql] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166384491?wrap=1) script to make sure you are starting with the correct set of tables (p_Band, p_Artist, etc.). (0 points)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Create the bandselect.php file (20 points)
--------------------------------------------------

The page should contain a drop-down list that is populated dynamically from the p_Band table. The list should show only the band title and should be ordered by title. Only the band's id should be passed to bandinfo.php.

Your bandselect.php should run a script that calls bandinfo.php to display the current data about the selected band.

Step 2: Create bandinfo.php (30 points)
---------------------------------------

This page must display the information about the selected band. This should include the year formed, the names of the members, the albums the band has released, and the year each album was released. Within reason, it is up to you what you include and how you display it, but points will be given based on how well you demonstrate your skills in PHP and HTML to produce an attractive and informative website.

--------------------------
Submitting Your Assignment
--------------------------

This is a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Your mentor will verify with you whether all members made equal contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade accordingly.

Submit the following on Canvas:

* A text file with the full URL to the page created for this assignment

* Your full code for bandselect.php and bandinfo.php.

Once you have submitted, check that your documents open correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open the web page from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score. Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

Ever wonder why a company invests in market X instead of Y, or why consumers prefer brand A over B? Our faculty members and doctoral students are answering these questions every day through research. Your participation in behavioral studies is critical for at least two reasons. First, the Kelley School of Business is a leading research institution with a reputation for excellence. Our faculty members are on the cutting edge of science, looking to improve company, consumer, and societal welfare. Second, your participation leads to marketplace solutions that affect how business is conducted, including much of the work you will soon be doing. The data you provide make a difference to us, other consumers, and the broader economy.

Over the course of the term you will be asked to participate in SIX 30-minute Department of Marketing study sessions for class credit.  This gives you an opportunity to learn about marketing as a participant and get a view of how marketing research is done.

You will receive one (1) Sona credit for each study session, which may contain one or more studies. For example within a 30-minute study session, 15-minute studies (.5 research credit), 10-minute studies (.33 research credit), or 5-minute studies (.167 research credit) may be offered.

You have been, or will be shortly, added to the "course” [SP24 Kelley Behavioral Studies] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2227811) in Canvas.  All information regarding study sessions, including announcements, will be handled there.

You are responsible for registering for and completing the number of study sessions offered to your class.  That is done through the Kelley School of Business registration system, [Sona] (https://kelley.sona-systems.com/).  Toward the end of the first week of classes, you will receive a welcome email from [Sona] (https://kelley.sona-systems.com/) containing your login information with a password unique to [Sona ] (https://kelley.sona-systems.com/)(your userid is your IU userid).

Assigned study sessions will be offered throughout the term, and enough will be offered for all students to meet their assignment needs.  However, as the term progresses and extra credit sessions are offered, availability will decrease - do not wait until the end of the term to try and complete the study session assignment!  You will run out of opportunities and not be able to earn all the available credits.

Not attending a study session for which you have registered is considered unprofessional and you will be held accountable.  If you miss three study sessions, you will be prohibited from registering for future study sessions.  Be sure to cancel your registration if you are unable to attend.

Once you are added to both sites, please visit [SP24 Kelley Behavioral Studies] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2227811) and [Sona] (https://kelley.sona-systems.com/) and familiarize yourself with the information provided.  If after review, you have questions, please email the Behavioral Lab Manager, Danielle Willibey, [jwillibe@iu.edu] (mailto:jwillibe@iu.edu).

Description:
--------
Purpose 
--------

In this individual assignment, you will build on the work you did in Assignment 2 to create a more complex conceptual schema (in this case an ERD).

This assignment aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:

*

* Analyze requirements and solicit information to design a Conceptual Schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

-----
Task 
-----

It is almost always the case that requirements are clarified, refined, expanded, and even changed during the design process, often at the last minute. After presenting our original ERD to the client, we have found out more about the requirements for the WeFlyU Airport system.

In this assignment, you will:

* Modify the ERD structure given below and make the necessary changes to include the new requirements

* Complete the ERD by adding the attributes from the original requirements along with all required cardinality constraints

Original Requirements (Represented in the ERD below)
----------------------------------------------------

* Every airplane has a registration number, crew size, and year built, and each airplane is of a specific model.

* The airport accommodates a number of airplane models, and each model is identified by a model number(e.g., DC-10) and has a capacity, a weight, dimensions (length, wingspan, height), max range, and max speed.

* A number of technicians work at the airport. You need to store the name, SSN, address, and email salary of each technician. Each technician is an expert on one or more plane model(s), and his or her expertise may overlap with that of other technicians.  This information about technicians must also be recorded.

* Traffic controllers must have an annual medical examination. For each traffic controller, you must store the date of the most recent exam.

* All company employees (including mechanics) contribute to the company pension plan.  You must store the retirement account number of each employee. You can assume that each employee is uniquely identified by his or her social security number.

* The airport has a number of tests that are used periodically to ensure that airplanes are still airworthy. Each test has a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test number, a name, and a maximum possible score.

* The FAA requires the airport to keep track of each time a given airplane is tested by a given technician using a given test. For each testing event, the information needed is the date, the number of hours the technician spent doing the test, and the score that the airplane received on the test. 

ERD For Original Requirements
-----------------------------

The ERD below shows a good solution to Part One. Please use this as a starting point rather than using the version created by your team. This will ensure that all students start out from the same place and will make grading easier.

[WeFlyU Image.PNG] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383622/preview)

[This file] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166384069?wrap=1) is a draw.io file containing this ERD. You do not have to build the starting ERD yourself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Click the link and choose to Download the file (Save File).

* Open draw.io and choose Open Existing Diagram.

* Find the file among your downloads and open it.

New Requirements

* Technicians perform repairs on airplanes as necessary and record the date, start/finish time, problem, part numbers used, resolution, and cost.

* The airport needs to store the date and score for every medical exam given to controllers for historical purposes.

* All airplane flights in and out of the airport must be recorded. Each time a specific airplane lands or takes off, the following information must be recorded: time, date, which controller authorized it, runway number, what plane it was, and who was piloting the plane.

* Pilot information must be recorded and consists of an ID number, full name, address, license number, phone number, date of birth. Pilots are private citizens, not employees of the airport. Each pilot is certified to fly one or more models of airplanes.

* Employees have multiple phone numbers.

* For repairs,  part information is now stored in the system. Each part has a number, manufacturer part number, description, image, cost, and what model of airplane it can be used on.

Submitting Your Assignment
--------------------------

* This is an individual assignment

* Your ERD document format must be a .png or .jpg file.

* No hand-drawn submissions will be accepted.

* Submit the ERD document to Canvas.

* The ERD should include all entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality constraints. For this assignment, cardinality constraints are required.

* Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

* Late penalties will be applied according to the schedule in the syllabus.

--------------
Grading Rubric

--------------

The ERD will be graded on the following basis:

* Are all entities correctly identified and typed as strong or weak? (12 points)

* Are the relationships between the entities correctly identified? (10 points)

* Are the attributes of each entity correctly identified and categorized? (10 points)

* Are all cardinality constraints correctly identified? (12 points)

* Is the ERD in a clear, easy-to-read layout? (6 points)

It is useful to include notes in an ERD. Sometimes you may see more than one way that something could be implemented, and you would want your grader to know that considered alternatives. More importantly (in the real world), there is often information in a project's specs that cannot be captured in an ERD (or implemented in the resulting database). Are notes included to explain the reasoning behind any decisions you made in situations where there seemed to alternative ways to represent the information? Including notes may save you points that would otherwise have been deducted.

Other sources may use different conventions for ERD symbols and design. If your ERD does not follow the style taught in this course, you will be required to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

--------
Purpose 
--------

In this team assignment you will demonstrate how to create a conceptual schema (in this case an ERD) and then convert it into a logical schema (in this case, a relational model)

This assignment aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:

*

* Analyze requirements and solicit information to design a Conceptual Schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

* Convert an ERD into a Logical Schema

-----
Task 
-----

My Back Pages is a bookstore that sells academic and scholarly books. The client is new to the world of databases and is not very precise about specifying requirements.

As the consultants, you will have to make reasonable assumptions about the business and explain your implementation choices. The client (i.e., your instructors) will revise and expand on these decisions to provide you with an ERD and additional information for the individual assignment in the second half of this module.

* My Back Pages has several branches throughout Bloomington. Employees may be assigned to work at any of the branches at different times.

* Employees are identified by an ID and have a full name, date of birth, SSN, address, multiple phone numbers, a gender, and a hire date.

* A manager runs a branch and is responsible for all operations at that branch.

* Cashiers sell books to customers. All purchases should have a date/time and receipt number recorded.

* Books are identified by an ISBN number which identifies the title, one or more authors, a published date, a publisher, and an edition number. The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is assigned to each edition of a book.

* Books are stocked on shelves by employee stockers. Each shelf has a location within a branch, a quantity, and an ID.

* The manager orders books from suppliers. The system must capture the date and invoice number of all orders. Suppliers have an ID, a name, a contact person, a website, an address, and a phone number.

As a team, you will need to figure out what should or should not be included in the ERD and what additional information is needed and explain your reasoning for any decisions you make. These should appear as a series of notes in the ERD document. Part of your grade will depend on how reasonable these decisions are and how well you explain them in the notes.

Finally, you will convert your ERD to a logical model and include the conversion as part of your submission.

Note: This assignment contains information that may not apply to the database such as workflow or job information. Your job is to figure out what is important for the data model of the organization.

-------------------------
Submitting the Assignment
-------------------------

This is a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Your mentor will verify with you during lab whether all members made equal contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade accordingly.

* Your ERD document format must be .doc, .docx, .pdf, .jpg, or .png. No hand-drawn submissions will be accepted.

* Submit the ERD document to Canvas.

* The ERD should include all entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities. You do need to include cardinality constraints.

* Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

* NOTE: The next assignment builds on this ERD, and we provide a solution to this assignment as a starting point. Therefore, absolutely no late submissions will be allowed for this assignment.

* Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

[MyBackPages_Solution.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383139/preview)

This [file] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383115?wrap=1) is a draw.io file containing this ERD. You do not have to build the starting ERD yourself (unless you're using software other than draw.io).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Click the link and choose to Download the file (Save File).

* Open draw.io and choose Open Existing Diagram.

* Find the file among your downloads and open it.

New Requirements and Clarifications
-----------------------------------

* Employees are assigned exactly one mentor who helps them with any issues they may face. An employee may mentor more than one employee.

* My Back Pages has decided to implement an emergency response training program at the request of their insurance company:

* All staff are required to take a series of training classes on emergency procedures. Classes have an ID, a title, and a training level.

* Each class has one or more accompanying exams which must be passed. Each exam has an ID, a title, a max score, and a passing score. If the employee fails an exam, they must take the class again.

* The system must keep track of each time employees take a class or exam.

* My Back Pages sells used books as well as new ones. Each copy of a book has a condition, purchase price, sale price, date purchased, and date sold.

You will need to figure out what additional information is needed and explain your reasoning for any decisions you make. These should appear as a series of notes in the ERD document. Part of your grade will depend on how reasonable these decisions are and how well you explain them in the notes. Be aware that creating an ERD is an art rather than an exact science. In more complex applications, there are often several alternative ways information could be represented. There is no single "correct" answer. Your goal is to come up with an ERD that contains the data in such a way that useful information could be retrieved. Sometimes, you have information about the system that simply cannot be represented in an ERD but would have to be implemented later by a programmed business rule. Example: "Students must pay fees before they take the class." The point is that you need to include sufficient information that someone who knows how to read an ERD can understand your design and why you chose to design it that way. An obvious example is whether or not to use an ISA relationship: both choices may well be okay, but you should explain why you chose to use one or not.

Finally, you will convert your ERD to a logical model and include the conversion as part of your submission.

Submitting the Assignment
-------------------------

* This is an individual assignment. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment. All work must be your own.

* Your ERD document and Conversion document format must be .doc, .docx, .pdf, .jpg, or .png. No hand-drawn or hand-written submissions will be accepted.

* The ERD should include all entities, attributes, relationships, cardinality constraints, and notes explaining your decisions.

* Submit the ERD document to Canvas. Also submit your notes/discussion and your Conversion.

* Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

* Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

----------------
Grading Criteria

----------------

The ERD (35 points) will be graded on the following basis:

* Are all entities correctly identified and typed as strong or weak? (6 points)

* Are the relationships between the entities correctly identified? (6 points)

* Are the attributes of each entity correctly identified and categorized? (6 points)

* Are all cardinality constraints correctly identified? (4 points)

* Is the ERD in a clear, easy-to-read layout? (3 points)

* In this extension of the assignment, you included two new concepts - book copies, and a mentoring relationship. For each of these two new concepts, address the following questions in your ERD notes:

* What design alternatives did you consider? (3 points)

* Did you make reasonable decisions? (3 points)

* Does your ERD accurately match the decisions you made? (4 points)

The logical model (15 points) will be graded on the following basis:

* Is your conversion an accurate representation of the ERD you submitted?

* Are all tables properly identified? (5 points)

* Are all attributes correctly identified in each table? (5 points)

* Are all keys correctly indicated? (5 points)

Purpose 
--------

In this individual assignment you will use a SQL script to create tables in MySQL based on a given relational model and  populate those tables with appropriate data. You will then add additional tables and write basic SELECT queries to retrieve information from the database.

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

3. Implement the Logical Schema in a Relational Model (SQL)
4. Populate a Relational Database with Data using SQL

------
 Task 
------

[ctbp.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166384245/preview)Your task is as follows:

Step 1: Use the provided assignment31.sql script to create this simple database (5 points) :

*

* Download the [assignment31.sql] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383124?wrap=1) file. (Note: We are naming the tables with the "A_" prefix so that they will not conflict with the customer, book, etc. that you will still need for in-class exercises.)

* If you have not done so already, create a SQL directory in your Burrow home directory by issuing the following command: mkdir sql

* Use WinSCP or Cyberduck to upload the assignment31.sql file to your SQL directory on Burrow

* Making sure you are in your SQL directory on Burrow, log in to your individual MySQL account. (See [WATCH | Getting Started with MySQL] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/pages/watch-%7C-getting-started-with-mysql-2) for help.)

* Run the assignment31.sql script by issuing the following command in MySQL: source assignment31.sql This will create the four tables pictured above and populate them with data. Note: the file must be in your SQL directory, and you must log into MySQL from that same directory for this to work!

*

Step 2: Modify the script by adding SQL code at the end of your script to make the following changes to the database (5 points each). Note: You can either edit the script locally and re-upload and run it to make sure it runs correctly, or you can edit it on the server. The first approach is easier!

* Create a table named A_bookcase that has the following attributes: bcid (primary key), location, num_shelf, capacity

* Create a table named A_book_bookcase with the following attributes: bookid (foreign key to id in A_book),  bcid (foreign key to bcid in A_bookcase), quantity

* Add statements at the top of your script to drop these two new tables so that the script can be run multiple times.

* Insert the following data into A_bookcase and A_book_bookcase
[bookcase.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383175/preview)

* Change Matt's address to 808 Bloom Street. Use an UPDATE statement. Do not simply change the original INSERT statement.

* Add the attribute “format” to the A_book table and update the data to indicate the format of each book. Use an ALTER TABLE followed by an UPDATE statement. Do not simply change the original INSERT statement. The Hacker Ethic and The Code Book should be paperback and Web Programming should be hardback.

Step 3: Add the following SELECT queries to at the bottom of your script (5 points each):

* Find the location of all bookcases with a capacity between 40 and 45.

* Find the title and bookcase ID of all books not stored on bookcase 101.

* Find the title, price, publisher, and quantity of all paperback books.

-------------------------
Submitting the Assignment
-------------------------

* This is an individual assignment. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment. All work must be your own.

* Submit your script as a single file titled assignment31.sql  on Canvas.

* If you need help with creating and running a .sql script, check out this video:

*

* Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

* Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

***Only the Team Lead needs to read this page

Welcome to our second team meeting! 😊 Be forewarned, there are lots of instructions on this page. Please read carefully so you're sure to conduct and submit your meeting properly.

----------------------
What You're Submitting
----------------------

* Embed your Team Meeting Recording (be sure to keep reading on HOW to submit. This is very important)

* SUBMIT in the Canvas text box:

* Date of your meeting

* Names of those who attended, the Team Lead AND those who were not in attendance

* Copy/paste the detailed meeting agenda  

* If you (the Team Lead) didn't leave time at the end of the meeting to complete the CoStudy evaluations be sure to remind your team to submit theirs.

---------------
Team Meeting #2
---------------

First off, if you are the Team Lead read [this checklist] (https://indiana-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nalspaug_iu_edu/ES6ZIfcL1Q9PqFwa9j7lEIwB90SIMHPwuyfJ_So1KVcBHg?e=bbZbw5) carefully. This document contains:

* How to create and share an invitation for a Zoom meeting

* BE SURE TO LOG INTO zoom.iu.edu. This gives you unlimited time on Zoom. If you use the free version of Zoom, you'll only have 40 minutes, which isn't enough time.

* If you're in the Zoom App and it asks you to log in, be sure to click "Sign in using SSO" at the bottom of the sign on page. That will re-route you to the IU sign on.

* Support numbers if you have trouble

* Several things you need to be sure to do during the meeting (ex: make sure everyone is participating, model healthy debate, etc).

*Do NOT hold your meeting without reading the [checklist] (https://indiana-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nalspaug_iu_edu/ES6ZIfcL1Q9PqFwa9j7lEIwB90SIMHPwuyfJ_So1KVcBHg?e=bbZbw5).

Asynchronous Lab - will be posted here by Tuesday at 1pm

While the recording is ~40 minutes, your meeting will likely run longer because you'll be playing the Stress Tolerance video and you will be leading your teams through the exercises I only described. 

* To know you're doing a thorough job, the meeting should be at least 60 minutes. Less than that is an indication that you didn't fully cover the content.

PowerPoint Slide Deck to use for your meeting: [Self Control_NW_stdt.pptx. ] (https://indiana-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/nalspaug_iu_edu/ERxZ2r8j_rJAtigE1PmWJIUBVuFOL1rl715TXFiglvnj8w?e=cRhPYw)

* (be sure to click "share sound" and "optimize video" when sharing it during your Zoom meeting)

IMPORTANT:

* You won't be able to download the slide deck. 

* It will open up in IU Onedrive/SharePoint and you'll use the online version of PowerPoint.

* You do not need to request access. If you log in using your IU Username and Passphrase, you'll be able to open it.

Here is a link to the [slide deck] (https://indiana-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/nalspaug_iu_edu/ERxZ2r8j_rJAtigE1PmWJIUBVuFOL1rl715TXFiglvnj8w?e=cRhPYw) I used for this week's video. You will use this with your teams. Be sure to look at the "Notes View" (click on "View" and then "Notes") as you'll find notes on what to talk about and instructions on what to do on each slide

* During your Team Meeting, please adjust the size of the slide so that your teams cannnot see the notes.

* You can pull the slide deck up on your tablet or phone so you can see the notes if you'd like. 

* When sharing your screen at the start of your meeting, you MUST click on "Share sound" and "Optimize for video clip" so your teammates can hear the video.

Objectives of the Recordings:  

Uploading your Team Meeting Recordings accomplishes many objectives:

* The recording documents your attendance (which is mandatory)

* The Team Lead demonstrates leadership skills resulting in a completed team deliverable

* All team members experience the lab activity from this week

* You experiment with and become proficient at attending and leading virtual meetings

* You have an opportunity to demonstrate various leadership best practices

Instructions:

Read through all of these instructions before beginning.

* Before your team meeting:

* See [Checklist instructions] (https://indiana-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nalspaug_iu_edu/ES6ZIfcL1Q9PqFwa9j7lEIwB90SIMHPwuyfJ_So1KVcBHg?e=bbZbw5) for how to set up your meeting.

* Download the slide deck to use during the meeting (see link to the slide deck, above)

*

During your team meeting:

* All team members must remind the host (the Team Lead) to record the Zoom meeting at the start

* If the meeting isn't recorded, you must do it again

* A notification on the top left will show if it's recording

* I highly suggest that you record to the cloud because of upload times for such a large file

* Leave time at the end of your meeting for everyone to open Costudy and complete the evaluations to ensure no one on your team forgets.

* REMINDER: When sharing your screen at the start of your meeting, you MUST click on "Share sound" and "Optimize for video clip" so your teammates can hear the video.

* Every team member must be in a different location and their video camera must be on the entire meeting to be counted as present.

*

*

* If you are absent from a team meeting, you will lose up to 100 professionalism points.

Overall Info

* A webcam is required 

* Computers with webcams are located on the 4th floor of Wells Library, West Tower (non-reservable)

* Group study rooms on 1st floor of West Tower of Wells Library has space/privacy for recording, video meetings, etc. non-reservable)

Purpose 
--------

In this team-based assignment your team  will demonstrate how to use a SQL script to create tables in MySQL based on a given relational model and  populate those tables with appropriate data. You will then add additional tables and write basic SQL SELECT queries to retrieve information from the database.

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

3. Implement the Logical Schema in a Relational Model (SQL)
4. Populate a Relational Database with Data using SQL

------
 Task 
------

This is a team based assignment. Your team task is to:

Step One: Develop a SQL script that creates all of the tables based on the following relational model (10 points):
artist(id, fname, lname, dob, gender)

band(id,title, year_formed)

member(artistID->, bandID->, date_joined, date_left, instrument)

album(id, title, year_published, bandID->)

song(id, title, length, albumID->)

Notes:

* The names of the tables and the columns in your SQL script should be EXACTLY as is given in the above conversion.

* If an artist is still in a band, then the date_left column in the member table would be NULL.

* Be sure to set up primary and foreign keys correctly and add the “engine=innodb” statement.

* You may use [Example SQL Script] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/pages/example-sql-script) as a guide to help you 

Step Two: For each of the 5 tables, create your own data to insert into each table according to the following requirements (5 points per table):

* There is a minimum of five rows of unique data per table unless otherwise specified.

* One band must have at least four artists, and one of those artists left and rejoined the band after 12 years.

* One artist must have been in three bands at different times, and another artist must still be in two bands at once.

* All bands must have at least two albums with three bands having more than two albums.

* At least two female artists must have two or more albums in the same band.

* Each album must have 3-5 songs.

* At least 4 songs must be more than 5 minutes long.

Notes:

* Make sure to add your INSERT queries into the SQL script.

* Download and complete the [Assignment32Data.doc] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383142?wrap=1) file and submit it with your assignment. This will assist the grader in validating that your data meets the above requirement.

Step Three: Add the following  SELECT queries at the bottom of the SQL script. (5 points each)

* Choose a year. Return the titles of all albums released that year by any band. Make sure there is at least 1 album returned.

* Return the band name, album title, and song title for all songs more than five minutes in length. Make sure there is at least 1 result returned.

* Choose a band. Return the names of all songs that the band has released along with the year the album containing the song was released.

-------------------------
Submitting the Assignment
-------------------------

This is a team assignment.Please make sure your team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be included.

Description:
--------
Purpose 
--------

In this assignment you and your team will learn more about how a basic Entity-Relationship Diagram is created from system requirements.

This assignment aligns with the following I308 course learning outcome:

*

* Analyze requirements and solicit information to design a Conceptual Schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

-----
Task 
-----

Your task as a team is to create an ERD for WeFlyU Airport, a local airport that maintains a fleet of small planes. The information below was given by the airport's manager.

* Every airplane has a registration number, crew size, and year built, and each airplane is of a specific model.

* The airport accommodates a number of airplane models, and each model is identified by a model number(e.g., DC-10) and has a capacity, a weight, dimensions (length, wingspan, height), max range, and max speed.

* A number of technicians work at the airport. You need to store the name, SSN, address, email, and salary of each technician. Each technician is an expert on one or more plane model(s), and his or her expertise may overlap with that of other technicians.  This information about technicians must also be recorded.

* Traffic controllers must have an annual medical examination. For each traffic controller, you must store the date of the most recent exam.

* All airport employees (including technicians) contribute to the company pension plan.  You must store the retirement account number of each employee. You can assume that each employee is uniquely identified by his or her social security number.

* The airport has a number of tests that are used periodically to ensure that airplanes are still airworthy. Each test has a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test number, a name, and a maximum possible score.

* The FAA requires the airport to keep track of each time a given airplane is tested by a given technician using a given test. For each testing event, the information needed is the date, the number of hours the technician spent doing the test, and the score that the airplane received on the test. 

--------------------
Submitting Your Work
--------------------

This is a team assignment. Let your mentor know if any team member did not contribute to this assignment.

Refer to this video for help with creating a digital ERD using draw.io, our required way for you to create ERDs in this course:

 

* Your ERD document format must be a PNG file. No hand-drawn submissions will be accepted. If there is any difficulty in reading it may cause you to lose points.

* Submit the ERD document to Canvas.

* The ERD should include all entities, attributes, and relationships. You do NOT need to include cardinality constraints.

* Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

* NOTE: The next assignment builds on this ERD, and we provide a solution to this assignment as a starting point. Therefore absolutely no late submissions will be allowed for this assignment.

* Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

--------------
Grading Rubric

--------------

The ERD will be graded on the following basis:

* Are all entities correctly identified and typed as strong or weak? (20 points)

* Are the relationships between the entities correctly identified? (10 points)

* Are the attributes of each entity correctly identified and categorized? (15 points)

* Is the ERD in a clear, easy-to-read layout? (5 points)

Other sources may use different conventions for ERD symbols and design. If your ERD does not follow the style taught in this course, you will be required to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

Purpose 
--------

The purpose of this assignment is to re-familiarize yourself with some material you may have learned in previous core courses in preparation for future I308 assignments. The goals of this assignment are:

* To access your account on the Burrow server.

* To use some basic Unix commands to attain basic competency in navigating through files and directories.

* To learn how to expose a file in your Burrow account as a page on the web.

* To re-familiarize yourself with basic HTML.

-------------------------
Getting Started on Burrow

-------------------------

Your page must be hosted on the SICE Burrow server. Before you can build your web page, you will need a basic familiarity with connecting to and working on the Burrow server. Below is a demonstration video for both Windows and Mac users. You can also check out this [Burrow Help Page.] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/pages/read-%7C-burrow-help-page) 

Please let a TA or instructor know immediately if you can not access Burrow with your IU username!

---------
Your Task

---------

Your task is to create a new basic HTML page introducing yourself. This will be a way for your instructors to get to know you. If you have concerns about privacy, feel free to lie. We'll judge you on the quality of the web page, not the truthfulness of its content.

* This site must be a newly constructed site. Any reuse of a website or sites such as ChatGPT will be considered academic misconduct.

* You may include an external CSS page for styling if you like, as long as it is your own CSS page. You may not use templates or other external stylesheets. The only exception is the Skeleton grid (from I101) if you want to use an external CSS for structure only.

* The website must be appropriate for viewing in an academic setting, but the more creative your page is and the better your design is, the more points you will receive to achieve the maximum grade.

* Dreamweaver (and similar tools) or the use of templates is not permitted for any part. Write your HTML code using a text editor of your choice.

* The webpage can be of any HTML document type.

* You must validate your HTML page. You can find a validator at https://validator.w3.org/

* Please validate your page as the doctype that you choose, or leave it as auto. 

* The website must validate with no errors (warnings are okay).

* Your page must incorporate at least 8 of the following 12 items:

* At least one HTML table

* At least four DIV tags

* At least two SPAN tags

* At least three clickable (non-dead!) links

* At least one list with at least three items in the list

* At least two images (not counting a banner), of which at least one must be a non-dead link

* At least two different levels of headings

* A background color other than the default and/or a background image

* A banner image of your own creation

* Text modified at least three different ways

* At least three of the following tags: STRONG VAR EM CITE CODE ACRONYM ABBR

* At least three of the following tags: P BR PRE DIV BLOCKQUOTE

--------------------------
Submitting Your Assignment

--------------------------

* Submit to Canvas the URL link to your webpage. Example URL: http://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~rstark/index.html.  Code submitted to Canvas will not be accepted.

* Indicate as a comment on your Canvas submission which 8 of the 12 you chose to include. To do so:

* First submit the assignment (the basic url).

* The go into "Grades" in Canvas.

* Click on Assignment 1

* Enter your comment in the comments area at the right of the screen.

* Once you have submitted, check that your link works correctly from Canvas. If your page does not load properly from the computer they are using, the graders will not be able to grade it.

--------------
Grading Rubric
--------------

* You will get zero if your page is not hosted on the Burrow server.

* You will get 5 points if your submitted URL successfully links to a page on the Burrow server. Your page must be on the Burrow server, not your own machine!

* Each element successfully implemented from the requirements list (up to 8) will earn 2 points

* The quality of the design will be the basis for 4 points. A web page that receives all 4 points for the design will have an aesthetically pleasing design utilizing :

* An appropriate color palette

* Excellent layout and spacing

* Appropriate typography choice

* Including the required comment with your submission will earn 5 points.

* If your page is not on the assigned topic, you will be required to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score. (And we will suspect you of using a web page that was not newly created for this assignment!)

* If your link does not successfully open your page or if you have used an unpermitted template, you will be instructed to resubmit and will receive a maximum of 50% of the points for the assignment.

----------------------------------------------
Week 1 - Emotional Intelligence and Leadership
----------------------------------------------

* Explain the research connecting emotional intelligence to leadership and team effectiveness

* List and define elements of emotional intelligence

* Understand the prevalence of mental health challenges

---------------------------------
Emotional Intelligence and BlueEQ
---------------------------------

This semester, you will take an assessment called Blue EQ. This assessment will help you identify your strengths and areas of growth. Throughout the semester we will gain an understanding of the elements in the Blue EQ assessment and how you can improve your emotional intelligence to become a stronger leader. Some of these concepts seem like common sense - you may read through the concepts and think, "I know that." The question I'd like you to consider is, "Do I do that?...and and do I do it well?" Knowledge does not equate to regular practice in our lives. Each of us can improve, grow, and develop.

Why is Emotional Intelligence Important?

* "If your emotional abilities aren't in hand, if you don't have self-awareness, if you are not able to manage your distressing emotions, if you can't have empathy and have effective relationships, then no matter how smart you are, you are not going to get very far." ~ Daniel Goleman

* "Seventy-five percent of careers are derailed for reasons related to emotional competencies, including inability to handle interpersonal problems; unsatisfactory team leadership during times of difficulty or conflict; or inability to adapt to change or elicit trust." ~ Center for Creative Leadership

Read about Goleman's Components of Emotional Intelligence

In Compass 3, we look at leadership and virtual teaming through the lens of Emotional Intelligence.  Emotional Intelligence (or EI) is “the other kind of smart” as Travis Bradberry calls it (co-author of Emotional Intelligence 2.0). It’s that something in each of us that is a bit intangible.

It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions.

[Daniel Goleman.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168047258/preview)

The term was popularized by Daniel Goleman in 1995 and grabbed the attention of the business world after his study of 200 large, global companies established that truly effective leaders were distinguished by a high degree of EI. Goleman outlined 4 areas of emotional intelligence. In this course, we use an instrument called Blue EQ. Blue EQ relates to much of Goleman's work but some of the terms are framed differently. 

What we use: Blue EQ

Our course is framed around the five Blue EQ competencies: 

* Self-Regard

* Self-Awareness

* Self-Control

* Social Effectiveness

* Social Perception

Building your Emotional Intelligence is the surest way I know of growing as a leader. 

[img_5-skills-5-dimensions.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168047743/preview)

Just take a look at the research: 

[87% of leaders who get bonues have high EQ.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168047127/preview)

Emotional Intelligence wins bonuses! 

* 87% of  the emotionally intelligent division heads at a global food and beverage company placed in the top third for annual salary bonuses because their divisions out performed yearly revenue targets by 15-20% in contrast to execs who lacked emotional intelligence who were rarely rated as outstanding in their reviews.

The US Air Force started selecting recruiters who had a high level of emotional intelligence. The result? A three-fold increase in success and a savings of nearly 3 million annually. And at L’Oreal (an organization about as different from the Air Force as you can get!) —the salespeople selected for their EI competency, outsold their counterparts by $91,000 in the very first year.

[US Air Force EI stats.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168046891/preview)

[Consulting firm EI Stats.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168046996/preview)

At a multi-national consulting firm, leaders with high EQ (Emotional Quotient), delivered $1.2 million more profit from their accounts than did other partners. 

 

Does EQ count as much as good ol' IQ?

So the research starts to stack up, but in the end, does EQ count as much as good old IQ? Won’t your technical skills always be more important than your people skills? Especially in the business world?  You might be surprised…

In research at an accounting firm, the partners with social skills (that’s an EI competency) added 110%  more incremental profit while those with really strong  analytical reasoning abilities added just 50% incremental profit. To be blunt: EQ trumps IQ for leaders. Our analytical skills are important but not AS important as self-awareness, self-management, empathy, and building relationships. 

[EQ trumps IQ] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168047252/download?wrap=1)

So, how strong do you think your Emotional Intelligence skills are?

As you consider this, you should know that in research comparing self-assessment to assessments by others, ALL leaders tend to overestimate their EI strength. 

The top performing leaders, overestimate their ability in at least one category and less effective leaders overestimate in all quadrants!

* You may remember in Compass 1 when we looked at your skills section from CareerLeader, we had you think of examples that proved that you had a skill, since it was human nature to overestimate our skills at times

* The same thing can happen with your Emotional Quotient. We may not be quite as good at these things as we think we are.  But Compass 3 is your chance to enhance your Emotional Quotient AND your leadership. 

My hope for you going forward in this class

I hope I’ve made a compelling case for pouring some of your energy, some of your attention, and some of your heart in to becoming an emotionally intelligent leader and team member this semester.

Week 2 - Leading Virtual Teams QuickCheck
-----------------------------------------

​Before you go further on this page, reflect for a moment on any remote work you have already done.

* What worked well for you?

* What did NOT work well in your virtual interactions? 

--------------------------------------------------
Read and Watch to Prepare for Quick Check (30 pts)
--------------------------------------------------

As you read and watch the resources below:

* Look for at least five virtual teaming best practices you would like to integrate into your Compass 3 team (and any other teams you're on at Kelley) this semester.

* Consider actions you can take before, during, and after a meeting to increase your team productivity and performance. 

* Write your five action items in your notes to discuss in your first team meeting. 

Resources on Virtual Teaming

Please watch and read the resources below before starting the Quick Check quiz.

​

Building Trust

The video to the left is from the Building Trust LinkedIn Learning course created by Professor Brenda Bailey-Hughes (a former Compass 3 professor) for the LinkedIn Learning Library. It has over 660,000 views!

In this 1ish-minute video you'll see a virtual team use eight different best practices.

Consider what these eight strategies might look like if you integrated them into your Compass 3 team.  

To recap the 8 strategies:

* Communicate on a variety of topics (some social, some work)

* Share time-zone burden (not an issue for your teams this semester!)

* Standardize communication procedures (have a consistent way to join meetings, message one another, etc.)

* Create a virtual team space for project documents

* Clarify goals, roles, and expectations (important with any team but even more so when the team meets virtually and can easily slip into a pattern of mistrust)

* Be a connector (help people on the team get to know one another better)

* Rotate power

* Communicate frequently

Leading Virtual Teams: Best Practice Insights

Click on the image to the right to read a case study on virtual teaming by Deloitte.

From the case:
"Recent Australian research shows that leading effective virtual teams does not require a huge investment in technology, but it does require strategies which are fit for purpose and not a carbon copy of face-to-face leadership practices. Intriguingly, virtual teams may experience higher levels of individual contribution and diverse thinking arising from chat, Yammer and polling technology."

"The Do's and Don'ts of Remote Team Communication"

Hate emojis?

This article shares (amongst other things):

"As a co-worker wisely pointed out to me — emojis are the emotions of a remote team."

Click on the image to the left to read more and see if it changes your mind!

"Project Aristotle"

"Much of the work done at Google, and in many organizations, is done collaboratively by teams. The team is the molecular unit where real production happens, where innovative ideas are conceived and tested, and where employees experience most of their work. But it’s also where interpersonal issues, ill-suited skill sets, and unclear group goals can hinder productivity and cause friction.

Following the success of [Google’s Project Oxygen research] (https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-google-sold-its-engineers-on-management) (HBR article) where the People Analytics team studied [what makes a great manager] (https://rework.withgoogle.com/jp/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness#introduction), Google researchers applied a similar method to discover the secrets of effective teams at Google. Code-named Project Aristotle - a tribute to Aristotle’s quote, "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" (as the Google researchers believed employees can do more working together than alone) - the goal was to answer the question: “What makes a team effective at Google?” (emphasis mine)

**This was a study conducted by Google on what makes teams (in person or virtual) effective. We will visit this idea again later in the semester as we approach the Social Effectiveness Case.

Week 2 - CoStudy Goal Setting Assignment
----------------------------------------

This semester CoStudy will be our mechanism for peer evaluation and reflection during the team meetings portion of the course. 

--------------------------------
CoStudy Introduction and Details
--------------------------------

CoStudy provides us a way to anonymously assess ourselves and our team lead each week.  

Overview of how we'll use it this semester

* We start with a goal-setting assignment (this one!) for you to consider how you'd like to engage with your team.

* After each team meeting, the Team Lead will do a self-assessment and the team members will assess the leader. Each should not take more than 20 minutes to complete.

* You'll have one check-in survey mid-way through the semester. This survey is for you to have an opportunity to communicate with your team and yourself about what is going well and what needs to improve with your team.

* You will receive an email when assessments become available on CoStudy and 24 hours before each assessment is due. 

This week's assignment

This week you will log into Costudy and complete the initial goal setting assessment.

* Set up your account in CoStudy by clicking on [THIS LINK.] (http://platform.costudy.co/join)

* Use this code: kqqtde.

* Enter your First and Last Name, your @iu.edu email, a password you can remember, and select your designated team.

* It is very important that you select the correct team number.

* You can find your Team Number in Canvas. Click on "People" (on the left) and then "Teams" along the top left of your screen

After you've set up your account, you will receive announcements when assessments become available and reminders 24 hours before they are due.

IMPORTANT!!!  Once the due date has passed, the assessment will be available for one day. Then it closes permanently.

* If you forget to fill out Costudy by the due date, you will have one day to complete for a 20% deduction

* After that, there is no option to reopen the assessment.

 

You do NOT need to enter anything into this assignment to receive credit. I will run a report directly from the CoStudy Platform that provides me with all the feedback you enter.

 Week 1 - Overview
------------------

On this page there are a couple of videos to watch, you'll take a Quick Check Quiz, and you'll see the due dates for the week.

In the rest of the module, you'll get an introduction to Emotional Intelligence and its importance in business (and in interviewing!), read articles about Emotional Intelligence, a page covering mental health statistics, take a couple of assessments, and participate in a Discussion.

---------------
Time Management
---------------

Time management is a very useful skill for your time at Kelley (especially if you're in ICore)! While some of us are better at this than others, time management can become more complicated when dealing with an online course as they require a tad bit more effort in time management. If you can master time management, you will have a great skill for life. 

Click the image to the right to watch a short video (3m 33 sec) about time management.

 

 

Disclaimer: The video mentions that managing your time puts your stress level "at a normal state." Please note that while time management can indeed reduce stress, if you're dealing with anxiety, you will likely need additional strategies to manage your anxiety.

-------

---------
 Purpose 
---------

The purpose of this discussion is for teams to create the SQL queries required by their Final Project and that were identified in [PROJECT | Step 4: Finalizing the SELECT Queries] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/assignments/15854219?wrap=1) as updated by their mentor and/or instructor.

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

------
 Task 
------

Your team task is to develop a single .sql script that contains the complete SQL SELECT queries for all queries identified in [PROJECT | Step 4: Finalising the SELECT Queries] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/assignments/15854219?wrap=1) [] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/assignments/15854217)as updated by your mentor and/or instructor.

At this point you will have to hard code some of the queries. Once you get your web front end working in the final step, the user will be able to select values that can be inserted into your queries via an input variable.

Please add comments to your MySQL script explaining where you plan to replace a hard-coded value with a variable. For example: "This query specifies Briscoe Quad. In the final version, the user will be able to specify the dorm in question."

Project Assignment: Creating and Testing an Educational Program on Conversational AI, Art, and Coding

Objective: Collaboratively develop and test an idea for an educational program that integrates Art, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Coding. You will also explore various educational technologies to implement in your program and justify their use within your idea for the following fictional call for proposals: [Call for Proposals: AI+Art+Programming] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204603/pages/call-for-proposals-ai+art+programming)

Instructions:

*

Form a Team: Meet with your randomly assigned teammates and work through initial ideas and questions.

*

Brainstorm Ideas: Come up with at least five lesson plan ideas that integrate Art, AI, and Coding. Bear in mind your target audience and how these ideas can effectively enhance their learning experience. Write your ideas down and ask ChatGPT or other language models to generate a lesson plan based on your ideas.

*

Developing Two Lesson Plans: Choose two lesson plan ideas from your list and develop these into more comprehensive lesson plans. Each plan should include at minimum: an aim, the learning outcomes, the necessary resources, including any technology tools, the teaching activities, and methods of assessment.

*

Explore Technologies: Research and explore various technologies that could enhance your lesson plans and overall program. These could be digital tools for presenting information, platforms for collaborative work, or helpful software for executing lessons. Include your technological choices and their supporting justifications in your program proposal.

*

Test Your Lessons: Before seeking feedback from others, test your lessons among your group. Roles can be assigned for this task: one or two students can act as teachers to lead the lesson, while the rest act as students to critically engage with the content. Make revisions as necessary based on the insights gained during this simulation.

*

Feedback from Peers: Present your two developed and tested lesson plans to other groups for feedback. Use their insights to refine and improve your plans further.

*

Writing a Cover Letter: In a one page cover letter, explain the overall learning goals, objectives, and vision of your educational program. Include details on how the chosen technologies will enhance the learning experience and how they're integrated into your lessons. Discuss what you learned from your tests. Attach the two example lesson plans.

*

Presentation: Present your refined and tested lesson plans along with your cover letter to the whole class. This presentation should encapsulate your entire process — from initial brainstorming, the technology exploration process, feedback incorporation, up to the final iterations of your lesson plans.

You can always refer to to the [Group Roles] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/group-roles) document if you need a refresher on what each role is responsible for.

What tasks did you agree to do for the project before work began

As discussed in class, at the start of each project step or group assignment, the group should break down the tasks required and make sure that everyone is clear on what is expected of them and that the work is distributed reasonably. It is the Facilitator’s task to spearhead this discussion, but all should contribute to it.

What tasks did you complete for the project

Ideally this should align with the tasks assigned at the start. If they do not, detail why.

If there were issues within the group, what steps did you take to resolve them

You may refer to the [group issues checklist] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/group-issues-checklist) to help organize your thoughts. Issues should be discussed with team members and mentor. Refer to the document your group created in [Establishing Expectations] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/establishing-expectations) for what was agreed upon and how your group agreed to handle them.

This assignment is in the Analyze/Model, Database Creation, Data Manipulation, and Data Display categories

--------
Purpose 
--------

The purpose of this assignment is to assemble and polish the final version of all the components of your project.

This activity aligns with all six of the I308 Course Outcomes.

----
Task
----

Your team Final Project task is to finish your final project by turning in a web-based interface for your queries as well as the final version of the documents you created in the various project steps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A final version of your ERD that represents the database as you actually built it.

* The final conversion of your ERD into a logical model.

* A MySQL script containing the final version of the code that you wrote to create your database tables and populate them with data.

* A file containing your MySQL code for of all the SELECT statements.

* A file containing all the html and PHP code that you used to create and run your web page(s).

* A .pdf file that describes exactly what each of your queries does and suggests input to provide positive and negative test to demonstrate that it works.

* If you did any "special" features, a .pdf file describing what they are and how you implemented them.

* The link to the home page of your project.

--------------------------
Submitting Your Assignment
--------------------------

This is a team assignment that is part of the Final Project assignment group. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed.

Once you have submitted, check that your links open correctly from Canvas.

Absolutely no late submissions will be accepted. Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

Submit the following files to this Canvas assignment to complete your final project:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A teamXX.pdf file that contains your team's final ERD (revised for any changes) and final relational model conversion. This should reflect the final structure of the project as you actually built it. It is highly unlikely that you did not revise your ideas as you implemented the project, so do not just resubmit the same ERD and Conversion you submitted previously.

* A teamXX-build.sql file containing the script you used tp build and populate your database.

* A teamXX-select.sql file containing your SQL code for of all the SELECT statements. The final SELECT statements will be tested by the graders through the PHP scripts that you create and further by running them directly in MySQL.

* A teamXX.zip file containing all of your PHP/HTML files.

* A teamXX.txt file containing the URL link to where the PHP/HTML for your project is located. This can be in an individual team member’s account.

* A teamXX.pdf file that contains suggestions for the grader to test your project and describes any special features of your project.

Notes

ERD reflects information as the database was actually built

ERD should be modified to be accurate to any changes that were made throughout development

Conversion reflects information as the database was actually built

Conversion should be modified to be accurate to any changes that were made throughout development

Final ERD reflects all standards established in class

See Modules 1 and 2 for standards

Final Conversion reflects all standards established in class

See Modules 1 and 2 for standards

sufficient data is created to populate tables and test queries

please include suggestions test data for grader to work with

select queries run without error

select queries produce valid output

queries meet the standards for including JOINs, aggregations, and subqueries

queries submitted are what was agreed to in step 5a of the project

all the SELECT queries avoid hard coding and use dynamic drop-downs where appropriate

the project's html page present the project in a reasonably attractive format

the output of the queries presented in suitable tabular format

dropdowns show human readable values, not just ID numbers

the PHP code correct and error-free

a special feature beyond other requirements

ex: implementing material like a login handled by sessions

-
 
-

Your team mentor will be the primary grader for your project. Your instructors will check the range of grades to ensure that the standard is consistent throughout all teams and sections.

Your project will first be graded on product quality, and by default, all members of a team will receive the same grade. However, adjustments may be made for individuals who have contributed significantly more or less to the project. Each team member must submit the Team Contribution Evaluation, and this may be used, in conjunction with your mentor's or instructor's interactions with the team, to make adjustments to individual grades.

This assignment will be graded for product quality on the following basis:

* Do the ERD and Conversion reflect the database as it was actually built, and does the final version follow all the conventions and standards for ERDs established in Modules 1 and 2? 

* Were the database tables created correctly? Are all primary and foreign keys correctly identified? Are the chosen data types for each column reasonable?

* Is the data created to populate the database sufficient to test the correctness of the queries? (Note: Please help out your grader by including suggestions on your web page for sample input choices that demonstrate the queries work.) 

* Do the SELECT queries run without errors and produce output? 

* Do the queries meet the standards for including JOINs, aggregations, and subqueries? Are the queries submitted what was agreed to in step 5a of the project? 

* Do all the SELECT queries avoid hard coding and use dynamic drop-downs where appropriate? 

* Does the project's html page present the project in a reasonably attractive format? Is the output of the queries presented in suitable tabular format? Do the dropdowns show meaningful values, not just ID numbers. 

* Is the PHP code correct and error-free? 

* By completing the items above correctly, you can receive up to 120 of the 130 points available. If you feel you have done so, you can attempt for some or all of the remaining 10 points by adding some "special" feature that goes beyond the basic requirements. For example, you could implement some of the material covered in Module 6. An attractive web page is not in iteself a special feature.

Your task as a team is to create an ERD of your business and a final set of data requirements for your final project. The data requirements should be set out as a set of bullet points similar to those we have been giving you for the ERD exercises. You should make it clear what the strong entities will be and the relationships between them. You must also include a separate list of 3 to 5 reports that could be generated from your proposed model that you think the client would find useful. Make sure to discuss your ideas with your mentor and ensure their feedback is included.

This is a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Your mentor will verify with you whether all members made equal contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade accordingly.

For a satisfactory evaluation, complete at least 10 of the following specifications

Specification

Notes

Team raised suitable requests for clarification and additional information in step 1a

Requirements cover the relevant parts of your partnered business

Submission is an ERD that follows the ERD conventions outlined in class.

Conventions are things like entities are outlined with a rectangle that's solid for strong entities or dashed for weak, relationships are indicated with a diamond, cardinalities are indicated along the line connecting the entity to a relationship with two numbers, etc. 

All entities implied are represented in the ERD

When taken together the entities in the ERD should be able to account for all the categories of things talked about in the ERD and those categories should be narrow enough to describe the thing in question without included a lot of extraneous items. eg. an entity called "physical things" would not be a good entity name as it's too broad.

All entities are correctly typed as strong or weak

All relationships are identified and represented in the ERD

Each relationship is connected to all of the relevant entities and no entities that are not relevant.

This is looking at each relationship to see if that relationship makes sense between the participants and that there's no important aspect of the relationship missing

Each entity has all relevant attributes represented in the ERD, attached to the correct entity

Attributes have correct indications for primary, composite, and multivalued

These are the things indicated in our ERD with underlines, parenthesis, and asterisks in the attributes 

Cardinalities are correctly indicated on all relationships

ERD layout is clear and easy to read

At least three useful reports identified that could be produced from the proposed system

The purpose of this discussion is for teams to submit their relational model and 5 possible data queries that could be run on the data model  instructors. This exercise will help teams determine what SELECT queries they will be required to create as part of their Final Project

-----
 Task
-----

Your task as a team is to submit the following items for your final project:

* Your final project relational model (conversion) with each table on a separate line. Indicate foreign keys by underlining them and adding a ^ after the attribute.

* Your current ERD so that the graders know the exact ERD you are converting. If you find that you needed to make changes to your ERD based on your ideas for queries, you should include some text pointing out the changes in the ERD compared to the one you submitted in Step 2.

* After consulting with your mentor, submit a description of 5 possible queries that you might create. Each query must:

* Involve data from multiple tables

* Be reasonably used in the organization modeled. 

* Clearly indicate what data should be returned

* Indicate the parameters that determine which instances of the data should be returned.

Example:  "Find all of the full names and phone numbers of customers who attended an event in a specified month."

The core work for this should have been completed in project step 1. This is a chance to revise your initial work to incorporate your mentor's feedback or other changes you would like to make and lock in your plan going forwards as well as start to think about the types of questions your database could be used to answer.

 

This is a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Your mentor will verify with you during lab whether all members made equal contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade accordingly.

 Purpose 
---------

The purpose of this project step is for teams to create their Final Project database based on the relational model turned in for Project Step 3 and populate it with sufficient data to demonstrate that their queries work correctly.

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

4. Populate a Relational Database with Data using SQL

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

------
 Task 
------

Your team task is to develop a single .sql script that:

* Creates all of the tables in your logical model

* Populates each table with enough data to show that the queries you turned in for Project Step 3 actually work as intended.

Data requirements:

* You need to create sufficient data to demonstrate that your design works and that your queries return the appropriate data.

* A general rule of thumb is at least 10 rows per table based on strong entities (the "base" tables), but consult with your mentor to make sure your data is sufficient. In particular, make sure that you are inserting lots of data for the transaction table(s) in your system.

* Do not simply insert multiple identical rows—for example, the same student living in the same room multiple times.  The data should be believable.

* Include any other data that is necessary for your system to function. Remember you are creating it to sell the system to a client so it should look as realistic as possible.

You may use [Mockaroo] (https://www.mockaroo.com/) or a similar data generation service to help create your data.

See the video below for a tutorial on how to use Mockaroo:

Submit a single .sql script file with both parts of the assignment. Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas.

---------------
 Specifications
---------------

For a satisfactory evaluation, complete at least 7 of the 8 specifications

Specification

Notes

Submitted file as a single .sql file

SQL script included that creates a table for each table in ERD

No more than 1 table is missing an attribute from the ERD

No more than 1 attribute is mistyped

An attribute is mistyped when it has a type that is not the best fit for the data indicated, like if an attribute that deals with numbers was given the varchar type. The size of the attribute does not have to be exactly what we have in mind, but should be broadly appropreate, for example using int(1000000) for a number that we expect to have at most 3 digits would be mistyped

Appropriate data is generated for each table

At least 10 rows of data is generated for each table

Data is varied and believable

Values should be different ex. not just repeating the same name or entering random letters for values.

SQL runs without errors

Description:
The following is an in-class activity that we should complete in 20 minutes and is equivalent to attendance for the day.

Compare generated goals and objectives for your lesson ideas using two different large language models.  Learn about the hierarchy of goals, objectives, and tasks in organizing a learning program.

Step 1: make a copy of the [Google Colab.] (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wPgWNm-MrwhEOwdTcuS7gdeZcrjjNxmg?usp=sharing) Note: we will walk through each cell of this code together for this activity.

Step 2: brainstorm a list of technologies, topics, facts, and activities you would like in your lessons (do this on your own first and then with your group)

Step 3: add this list to the Google Colab variable materials.

Step 4: use the gpt4 model and run the code that will generate a list of learning goals

Step 5: read through these goals and choose 3 that are most appropriate or interesting for you and put those in variable goal1, goal2, and goal3.

Step 6: run the code to generate learning objectives

Step 7: choose one objective and copy it into objective variable.  Note: if the text takes up more than one line, you may have to remove the line break.

Step 8: run the code to generate a list of tasks

Step 9: choose a task and generate an outline for slides and use of class time

Step 10: generate a report in markdown format.  Copy it into a text editor and save it as "gpt4-<your lastname>.md"

Step 11 (optional): repeat this process using a faster and much less expensive model, gpt-3.5-turbo

Step 12: Use this material as a resource for brainstorming lesson plan ideas with your group.

Description:

Purpose 
--------

In this individual assignment you will use a SQL script to create tables in MySQL based on a given relational model and  populate those tables with appropriate data. You will then add additional tables and write basic SELECT queries to retrieve information from the database.

------
 Task 
------

[visualization of 4 tables. text found in assignment link] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167820835/preview)Your task is as follows:

Step 1: Use the provided [assignment32.sql] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821506?wrap=1) script to create this simple database:

*

* Download the assignment32.sql file. (Note: We are naming the tables with the "A_" prefix so that they will not conflict with the customer, book, etc. that you will still need for in-class exercises.)

* If you have not done so already, create a SQL directory in your Burrow home directory by issuing the following command: mkdir sql

* Use WinSCP or Cyberduck to upload the assignment32.sql file to your SQL directory on Burrow

* Making sure you are in your SQL directory on Burrow, log in to your individual MySQL account. (See [WATCH | Getting Started with MySQL] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/watch-%7C-getting-started-with-mysql-2) for help.)

* Run the assignment32.sql script by issuing the following command in MySQL: source assignment32.sql This will create the four tables pictured above and populate them with data. Note: the file must be in your SQL directory, and you must log into MySQL from that same directory for this to work!

*

Step 2: Add a table to keep track of the various bookshelves in our store and another table to keep track of which books are on which shelves.

Each Bookcase has a location in the store, a number of shelves on the bookcase and how many books each shelf can hold. Our A_book_storage table keeps track of which books are on which bookcases using the id of the book, id of the bookcase, and the quantity of that particular book on that bookcase.

Modify the script from step 1 by adding SQL code at the end of your script to make the following changes to the database. Note: You can either edit the script locally and re-upload and run it to make sure it runs correctly, or you can edit it on the server. The first approach is easier!

* Create a table named A_bookcase that has the following attributes: bcid (primary key), location, num_shelf, shelf_capacity

* Create a table named A_book_storage with the following attributes: bookid (foreign key to bookid in A_book),  bcid (foreign key to bcid in A_bookcase), quantity

* Add statements at the top of your script to drop these two new tables so that the script can be run multiple times.

* Insert the following data into A_bookcase and A_book_storage
[Values for book_storage and bookcase tables. Available from instructor upon request.] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821507/preview)

* Change Jenny's address to 1001 Mountain Drive. Use an UPDATE statement. Do not simply change the original INSERT statement.

* Add the attribute “format” to the A_book table and update the data to indicate the format of each book. Use an ALTER TABLE followed by an UPDATE statement. Do not simply change the original INSERT statement. The Hacker Ethic and The Code Book should be paperback and Web Programming should be hardback.

-------------------------
Submitting the Assignment
-------------------------

* This is an individual assignment. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment. All work must be your own.

* Submit your script as a single file titled assignment32.sql  on Canvas.

* Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas

Specification

Notes

Submitted file named assignment32.sql

SQL script included that creates both the tables indicated in task step 2

All tables have the appropriate attributes

No more than 1 attribute is mistyped

An attribute is mistyped when it has a type that is not the best fit for the data indicated, like if an attribute that deals with numbers was given the varchar type. The size of the attribute does not have to be exactly what we have in mind, but should be broadly appropreate, for example using int(1000000) for a number that we expect to have at most 3 digits would be mistyped

Appropriate data for A_bookcase is added to table

Appropriate data for A_book_storage is added to table

assignment32.sql includes drop statements for A_bookcase and A_book_storage at the appropriate place in file

UPDATE statement that correctly changes Jenny's address

Format added to the A_book table using ALTER TABLE

Correct format added for each book

(book format is either paperback or hardback)

Purpose 
--------

In this individual assignment, you will demonstrate how to use a SQL script to write more advanced SQL SELECT queries to retrieve information from a band database.

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

-----
Task 
-----

Your task is to create a single .sql script that contains the SQL queries that produce the output for the following 5 questions.

* Download this script: [assignment41.sql.] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821531?wrap=1)

* After reading the queries that you need to write, you may need to edit the INSERT statements in the script as necessary to ensure you have adequate data.

* Add the SELECT queries for this assignment to the end of the script.

* Run your copy of the script in your individual MySQL database.

Do not hard code! In other words, do not use specific IDs in your WHERE instead of writing a query that works for any data added that might be added to the tables. Don't just look at the data, figure out the answer and then print that specific name or ID

Whenever you're asked for an artist's full name, combine the parts of their name into one value  - i.e. if fname = "Jane" and lname = "Doe", return "Jane Doe".

Question 1
----------

For each artist who is currently in a band and is under 30 years old: *

Return the artist’s full name, gender, date of birth (formatted like  "06/12/2019"), and the name of the band they are in with date joined formatted like "July 18, 2022".

Order the results by artist name

* You will not get full points if you just say something like DOB > '1992-03-23' (hard coded thirty tears ago today). The query would not age well!

Question 2
----------

For all artists who are currently in a band:

Return the artist’s full name (as a single value), the band name, and how long in years the artist has been in the band. The artist should only be shown once for each band.

(Hint: Remember that the data might include an artist who left a band and then rejoined. That is the challenge here!)

Question 3
----------

For each band that currently has a female member:

Return the name of the band and each female artist's full name (as a single value).

Order by band name and artist name.

As a bonus, you can try fining the information for all current members of bands that currently have a female member instead of just the female members themselves

Question 4
----------

Find the album title, band name, format, and total length of all albums released since January 1, 2000.

Order from longest to shortest.

Return the format as the word "single" or "double" rather than just the stored value "s" or "d". (Google 'mySQL IF() function'.)

As a bonus, you can try to get the total length to look like a reasonable time value rather than just a big number. This is hard! Google "summing time values in MySQL".

Description:
--------
Purpose 
--------

You have been hired to manage the database for the Fish 'n' Pickles Restaurant. The manager, Durant Pumfrey, hopes to use your expertise to complete a deep dive on the company's historical records before pressing ahead with new data (Questions 1 and 2). Durant is also curious about what happens when no manager is on duty to supervise (Questions 3 and 4). Database professionals frequently have to come up with such "ad hoc" queries to answer questions as they arise

This is a team assignment, but you will be working in the large dataset account (i308_data) with the big database.

In the Task section we will show the questions you are asked to solve and also will show the results from the system that you should get.

This module aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

------
 Task 
------

Your individual task is to create a single .sql script that contains just the SQL SELECT queries that produce the output for the following 5 questions.

Question 1
----------

"We are trying to reduce menu items, so we are looking for poor sales. Please show me the item name, item price, and number sold in year 2013, but limit it to only ten items and list them in order of least number sold."

Your results should match this exactly:

[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 11.52.23 AM.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821349/preview)

 Question 2

“Hmm... We probably should look at the total sales price. Please add (to the first query) the total sales for the items and order by the lowest 10 total sales. Let's see totals for 2013 and 2014."

Hint: This query can be written by making additions and/or minor changes to Question 1.

Your results should match this exactly:

[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 11.55.40 AM.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821061/preview)

 

Question 3
----------

We're going to build up to the times where there was no manager working. To start with, lets find all the unique shift and date combinations where there WAS a manager on duty.

Your results should match this with 75 more rows after these 10:

[A424.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821538/preview)

(85 total rows rows after row 10 omitted here for space)

Important Note: There are two different ways to write this that give different results. It turns out that the data is actually not consistent! Use the date in the emp_shift table rather than the day_of_week value in the shift table.

 

Question 4
----------

“Now let's look at staffing when no manager was on duty. For each day of the week during 2003, 2004, and 2005, how many staff (total) were working when no one was working in the manager role?"

Hint: You will need to use a subquery. The subquery will find the days when a manager was working, and the main query will return data about the days not returned by the subquery.

Your results should match this exactly:

Purpose 
--------

The purpose of this assignment is to practice creating web-based front ends in PHP to safely expose data from our bands database.

This activity aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

6. Create a Web-Based Portal For Interacting With Data

------
 Task 
------

Part One

Step 1: Create a web page animals.html that has the following input elements:

* A text box for a user name.

* A set of radio buttons for "the animal you are most afraid of" with four suitable choices.

* A dropdown for "your favorite animal" that offers four suitable choices. (Use w3schools to figure out how to set up this input type.)

* A "Proceed" button. When it is clicked the animals.php script should run.

Step 2: Create a PHP script animals.php that gives the inputs back to the user on a new page in a suitable format.

Part Two

Your task is to create a web-based front end for an INSERT query for the Artist table in the artist/band database in your individual account. If necessary, re-run the script provided for Assignment 8 to make sure your tables are correctly set up.

Refer to [EXAMPLE | Creating the Bands HTML and PHP Pages] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/example-%7C-creating-the-bands-html-and-php-pages) as a model for this process.

Step 0: Download this script and run it in your individual database  [Assignment51.sql] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821256?wrap=1)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Create the artist.html file 
------------------------------------

* The artist.html page should contain a form that will allow the user to add new data to the artist table.

* Make sure you correctly set the action attribute on your form to insertartist.php

Step 2: Create the insertartist.php file 
-----------------------------------------

* Create the insertartist.php file that takes the data from the artist.html form, connects to the database, and successfully inserts the data into the artist table. A message should be displayed to confirm that the record has been added.

Step 3: Confirm Results in MySQL
--------------------------------

* Log into your MySql account and write a simple select query that proves that your new record has been added to the artist table. Take a screenshot of the output.

--------------------------
Submitting Your Assignment
--------------------------

This is an individual assignment. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment. All work must be your own.

Submit the following on Canvas:

* A text file with the full URLs to all files created for this assignment

* Your full code for the following files:

* animals.html

* animals.php

* artist.html

* insertartist.php

* A file containing the screen shot from Step 3.

Make sure that you submit the Artist files, not the Band files that you were given in the example. It should be fairly simple to create the Artist files based on the Band example. You will get zero for this assignment if you submit the Band example.

Once you have submitted, check that your documents open correctly from Canvas.

As we start to get a feel for what information in the environment is useful to us, it's important to record and organize that information in a way that makes sure we have all the important pieces and understand how it all relates and fits together. This will enable us to have a solid foundation when we move forwards with creating our databases. In this assignment you and your team will learn more about how a basic Entity-Relationship Diagram is created from system requirements.

-----
Task 
-----

Your task as a team is to create an ERD for WeFlyU Airport, a local airport that maintains a fleet of small planes. The information below was given by the airport's manager.

* Every airplane has a registration number, crew size, and year built, and each airplane is of a specific model.

* The airport accommodates a number of airplane models, and each model is identified by a model number(e.g., DC-10) and has a capacity, a weight, dimensions (length, wingspan, height), max range, and max speed.

* A number of technicians work at the airport. You need to store the name, SSN, address, email, and salary of each technician. Each technician is an expert on one or more plane model(s), and his or her expertise may overlap with that of other technicians.  This information about technicians must also be recorded.

* Traffic controllers must have an annual medical examination. For each traffic controller, you must store the date of the most recent exam.

* All airport employees (including technicians) contribute to the company pension plan.  You must store the retirement account number of each employee. You can assume that each employee is uniquely identified by his or her social security number.

* The airport has a number of tests that are used periodically to ensure that airplanes are still airworthy. Each test has a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test number, a name, and a maximum possible score.

* The FAA requires the airport to keep track of each time a given airplane is tested by a given technician using a given test. For each testing event, the information needed is the date, the number of hours the technician spent doing the test, and the score that the airplane received on the test.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

This is a team assignment. Work together with your team using the roles you are assigned for this module to complete the task.

Refer to this video for help with creating a digital ERD using draw.io, our preferred way for you to create ERDs in this course:

 

* Your ERD document format must be a computer generated image file, like jpg or png or an image in a. No hand-drawn submissions will be accepted.

* Submit the ERD document to Canvas.

* Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will not be able to give you feedback and you will not meet specifications.

---------------
 Specifications
---------------

For a satisfactory evaluation, complete at least 8 of the following specifications

Specification

Notes

Submission is an ERD that follows the ERD conventions outlined in class.

Conventions are things like entities are outlined with a rectangle that's solid for strong entities or dashed for weak, relationships are indicated with a diamond, cardinalities are indicated along the line connecting the entity to a relationship with two numbers, etc. 

All entities alluded to in the task information are represented in the ERD

When taken together the entities in the ERD should be able to account for all the categories of things talked about in the ERD and those categories should be narrow enough to describe the thing in question without included a lot of extraneous items. eg. an entity called "physical things" would not be a good entity name as it's too broad.

All entities are correctly typed as strong or weak

All relationships alluded to in the task information are represented in the ERD

Each relationship is connected to all of the relevant entities and no entities that are not relevant.

This is looking at each relationship to see if that relationship makes sense between the participants and that there's no important aspect of the relationship missing

All attributes alluded to in the task information are represented in the ERD attached to the correct entity

Attributes have correct indications for primary, composite, and multivalued

These are the things indicated in our ERD with underlines, parenthesis, and asterisks in the attributes 

Cardinalities are correctly indicated on all relationships

ERD layout is clear and easy to read

Purpose 
--------

The purpose of this assignment is to re-familiarize yourself with some material you may have learned in previous core courses in preparation for future I308 assignments. The goals of this assignment are:

* To access your account on the Burrow server.

* To use some basic Unix commands to attain basic competency in navigating through files and directories.

* To learn how to expose a file in your Burrow account as a page on the web.

* To re-familiarize yourself with basic HTML.

-------------------------
Getting Started on Burrow

-------------------------

Your page must be hosted on the SICE Burrow server. Before you can build your web page, you will need a basic familiarity with connecting to and working on the Burrow server. Below is a demonstration video for both Windows and Mac users. You can also check out this [Burrow Help Page.] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/read-%7C-burrow-help-page) 

Please let a TA or instructor know immediately if you can not access Burrow with your IU username!

---------
Your Task

---------

Your task is to create a new basic HTML page introducing yourself. This will be a way for your instructors to get to know you. If you have concerns about privacy, feel free to lie. We'll judge you on the quality of the web page, not the truthfulness of its content.

* This site must be a newly constructed site. Any reuse of a website will be considered plagiarism.

* You may include an external CSS page for styling if you like, as long as it is your own CSS page. You may not use templates or other external stylesheets. The only exception is the Skeleton grid (from I101) if you want to use an external CSS for structure only.

* The website must be appropriate for viewing in an academic setting, but the more creative your page is and the better your design is, the more points you will receive to achieve the maximum grade.

* Dreamweaver (and similar tools) or the use of templates is not permitted for any part. Write your HTML code using a text editor of your choice.

* The webpage can be of any HTML document type.

* You must validate your HTML page. You can find a validator at https://validator.w3.org/

* Please validate your page as the doctype that you choose, or leave it as auto. 

* The website must validate with no errors (warnings are okay).

* Your page must incorporate at least 8 of the following 12 items:

* At least one HTML table

* At least four DIV tags

* At least two SPAN tags

* At least three clickable (non-dead!) links

* At least one list with at least three items in the list

* At least two images (not counting a banner), of which at least one must be a non-dead link

* At least two different levels of headings

* A background color other than the default and/or a background image

* A banner image of your own creation

* Text modified at least three different ways

* At least three of the following tags: STRONG VAR EM CITE CODE ACRONYM ABBR

* At least three of the following tags: P BR PRE DIV BLOCKQUOTE

---------------------------
 Submitting Your Assignment

---------------------------

* Submit to Canvas the URL link to your webpage. Example URL: http://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~rstark/index.html.  Code submitted to Canvas will not be accepted.

* Indicate as a comment on your Canvas submission which 8 of the 12 you chose to include. To do so:

* First submit the assignment (the basic url).

* The go into "Grades" in Canvas.

* Click on Assignment 1

* Enter your comment in the comments area at the right of the screen.

* Once you have submitted, check that your link works correctly from Canvas. If your page does not load properly from the computer they are using, the graders will not be able to grade it.

---------------
 Grading Rubric
---------------

* You will get zero if your page is not hosted on the Burrow server.

* You will get 10 points if your submitted URL successfully links to a page on the Burrow server. Your page must be on the Burrow server, not your own machine!

* Each element successfully implemented from the requirements list (up to 8) will earn 3 points

* The quality of the design will be the basis for the final 6 points. A web page that receives all 6 points for the design will have an aesthetically pleasing design utilizing :

* An appropriate color palette

* Excellent layout and spacing

* Appropriate typography choice

* Including the required comment with your submission will earn 10 points.

* If your page is not on the assigned topic, you will receive zero for this assignment. (And we will suspect you of using a web page that was not newly created for this assignment!)

* If your link does not successfully open your page or if you have used an unpermitted template, you will be instructed to resubmit and will receive a maximum of 50% of the points for the assignment.

This assignment is in the Analyze/Model category

--------
Purpose 
--------

In this individual assignment, you will build on the work you did in Assignment 2 to create a more complex conceptual schema (in this case an ERD).

 

-----
Task 
-----

It is almost always the case that requirements are clarified, refined, expanded, and even changed during the design process, often at the last minute. After presenting our original ERD to the client, we have found out more about the requirements for the WeFlyU Airport system.

In this assignment, you will:

* Modify the ERD your team created for Assignment 1.2 and make the necessary changes to include the new requirements

* Complete the ERD by adding the attributes from the original requirements along with all required cardinality constraints

Original Requirements (that should already be represented from 1.2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Every airplane has a registration number, crew size, and year built, and each airplane is of a specific model.

* The airport accommodates a number of airplane models, and each model is identified by a model number(e.g., DC-10) and has a capacity, a weight, dimensions (length, wingspan, height), max range, and max speed.

* A number of technicians work at the airport. You need to store the name, SSN, address, and email salary of each technician. Each technician is an expert on one or more plane model(s), and his or her expertise may overlap with that of other technicians.  This information about technicians must also be recorded.

* Traffic controllers must have an annual medical examination. For each traffic controller, you must store the date of the most recent exam.

* All company employees (including mechanics) contribute to the company pension plan.  You must store the retirement account number of each employee. You can assume that each employee is uniquely identified by his or her social security number.

* The airport has a number of tests that are used periodically to ensure that airplanes are still airworthy. Each test has a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test number, a name, and a maximum possible score.

* The FAA requires the airport to keep track of each time a given airplane is tested by a given technician using a given test. For each testing event, the information needed is the date, the number of hours the technician spent doing the test, and the score that the airplane received on the test. 

 

----------------
New Requirements
----------------

* Technicians perform repairs on airplanes as necessary and record the date, start/finish time, problem, part numbers used, resolution, and cost.

* The airport needs to store the date and score for every medical exam given to controllers for historical purposes.

* All airplane flights in and out of the airport must be recorded. Each time a specific airplane lands or takes off, the following information must be recorded: time, date, which controller authorized it, runway number, what plane it was, and who was piloting the plane.

* Pilot information must be recorded and consists of an ID number, full name, address, license number, phone number, date of birth. Pilots are private citizens, not employees of the airport. Each pilot is certified to fly one or more models of airplanes.

* Employees have multiple phone numbers.

* For repairs,  part information is now stored in the system. Each part has a number, manufacturer part number, description, image, cost, and what model of airplane it can be used on.

*

Purpose 
--------

In this team assignment you will demonstrate how to create a conceptual schema (in this case an ERD) and then convert it into a logical schema (in this case, a relational model)

This assignment aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:

*

* Analyze requirements and solicit information to design a Conceptual Schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

* Convert an ERD into a Logical Schema

-----
Task 
-----

My Back Pages is a bookstore that sells academic and scholarly books. The client is new to the world of databases and is not very precise about specifying requirements.

As the consultants, you will have to make reasonable assumptions about the business and explain your implementation choices. The client (i.e., your instructors) will revise and expand on these decisions to provide you with an ERD and additional information for the individual assignment in the second half of this module.

* My Back Pages has several branches throughout Bloomington. Employees may be assigned to work at any of the branches at different times.

* Employees are identified by an ID and have a full name, date of birth, SSN, address, multiple phone numbers, a gender, and a hire date.

* A manager runs a branch and is responsible for all operations at that branch.

* Cashiers sell books to customers. All purchases should have a date/time and receipt number recorded.

* Books are identified by an ISBN number which identifies the title, one or more authors, a published date, a publisher, and an edition number. The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is assigned to each edition of a book.

* Books are stocked on shelves by employee stockers. Each shelf has a location within a branch, a capacity, and an ID.

* The manager orders books from suppliers. The system must capture the date and invoice number of all orders. Suppliers have an ID, a name, a contact person, a website, an address, and a phone number.

As a team, you will need to figure out what should or should not be included in the ERD and what additional information is needed and explain your reasoning for any decisions you make. These should appear as a series of notes in the ERD document. Part of your grade will depend on how reasonable these decisions are and how well you explain them in the notes.

Finally, you will convert your ERD to a logical model and include the conversion as part of your submission.

Note: This assignment contains information that may not apply to the database such as workflow or job information. Your job is to figure out what is important for the data model of the organization.

-------------------------
Submitting the Assignment
-------------------------

This is a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Your mentor will verify with you during lab whether all members made equal contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade accordingly.

* Your ERD document format must be .doc, .docx, .pdf, or .jpg. No hand-drawn submissions will be accepted.

* Submit the ERD document to Canvas.

* The ERD should include all entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities. You do need to include cardinality constraints.

* Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will not be able to grade it and you will receive a grade of 0.

* NOTE: The next assignment builds on this ERD, and we provide a solution to this assignment as a starting point. Therefore, absolutely no late submissions will be allowed for this assignment.

* Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

This assignment is in the Database Creation category

--------
Purpose 
--------

In this team-based assignment your team  will demonstrate how to use a SQL script to create tables in MySQL based on a given relational model and  populate those tables with appropriate data. You will then add additional tables and write basic SQL SELECT queries to retrieve information from the database.

------
 Task 
------

This is a team based assignment. Your team task is to:

Step One: Develop a SQL script that creates all of the tables based on the following relational model:
artist(id, fname, lname, dob, gender)

band(id,title, year_formed)

member(artistID->, bandID->, date_joined, date_left, instrument)

album(id, title, year_published, bandID->)

song(id, title, length, albumID->)

Notes:

* If an artist is still in a band, then the date_left column in the member table would be NULL.

* Be sure to set up primary and foreign keys correctly and add the “engine=innodb” statement.

* You may use [Example SQL Script] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/example-sql-script) as a guide to help you 

Step Two: For each of the 5 tables, create your own data to insert into each table according to the following requirements:

* There is a minimum of five rows of unique data per table unless otherwise specified.

* One band must have at least four artists, and one of those artists left and rejoined the band after 12 years.

* One artist must have been in three bands at different times, and another artist must still be in two bands at once.

* All bands must have at least two albums with three bands having more than two albums.

* At least two female artists must have two or more albums in the same band.

* Each album must have 3-5 songs.

* At least 4 songs must be more than 5 minutes long.

Notes:

* Make sure to add your INSERT queries into the SQL script.

* Download and complete the [Assignment32Data.doc ] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821384?wrap=1)file and submit it with your assignment. This will assist the grader in validating that your data meets the above requirement.

Step Three: Add the following  SELECT queries at the bottom of the SQL script.

* Query A: Choose a year. Return the titles of all albums released that year that year by any band. Make sure there is at least 1 album returned.

* Query B: Return the band name, album title, and song title for all songs more than five minutes in length. Make sure there is at least 1 result returned.

* Query C: Choose a band. Return the names of all songs that the band has released along with the year the album containing the song was released.

For a satisfactory evaluation, complete at least 8 of the 11 specifications

Specification

Notes

SQL script included that creates all 5 of the tables indicated in task

All tables have the appropriate attributes

No more than 1 attribute is mistyped

An attribute is mistyped when it has a type that is not the best fit for the data indicated, like if an attribute that deals with numbers was given the varchar type. The size of the attribute does not have to be exactly what we have in mind, but should be broadly appropreate, for example using int(1000000) for a number that we expect to have at most 3 digits would be mistyped

Appropriate data for Artist is added to table

Appropriate data for Band is added to table

Appropriate data for Member is added to table

Appropriate data for Album is added to table

Appropriate data for Song is added to table

Query A accomplishes what is asked without errors

Query B accomplishes what is asked without errors

Query C accomplishes what is asked without errors

In this individual assignment, you will build on the work you did as a team in Assignment 2.1 to create a more complex conceptual schema (in this case an ERD).and then convert it into a logical schema (in this case, a relational model). You will also include notes that explain the choices you made in your design.

This assignment aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:

*

* Analyze requirements and solicit information to design a Conceptual Schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

* Convert an ERD into a Logical Schema

-----
Task 
-----

After reviewing the ERD submitted in the team assignment, the owner of  Bookery Nook has made some clarifications about her previous requirements. Together, these changes require an updated and expanded ERD and conversion. Your task is to modify the ERD structure and the Conversion given below and make the necessary changes to include the new requirements.

Original Requirements (Represented in the ERD and Conversion below)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* My Back Pages has several branches throughout Bloomington. Employees may be assigned to work at any of the branches at different times.

* Employees are identified by an ID and have a full name, date of birth, SSN, address, multiple phone numbers, a gender, and a hire date.

* A manager runs a branch and is responsible for all operations at that branch.

* Cashiers sell books to customers. All purchases should have a date/time and receipt number recorded.

* Books are identified by an ISBN number which identifies the title, one or more authors, a published date, a publisher, and an edition number. The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is assigned to each edition of a book.

* Books are stocked on shelves by employee stockers. Each shelf has a location within a branch, a capacity, and an ID.

* The manager orders books from suppliers. The system must capture the date and invoice number of all orders. Suppliers have an ID, a name, a contact person, a website, an address, and a phone number.

ERD for Original Requirements
-----------------------------

[BookeryNook Part One-1-1.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821333/preview)

This file is a [draw.io] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ITeqg2ps_ikP10HbEJGOiuhrf0qFvKHv/view?usp=sharing) file containing this ERD. You do not have to build the starting ERD yourself (unless you're using software other than draw.io).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Click the link and choose to Download the file (Save File).

* Open draw.io and choose Open Existing Diagram.

* Find the file among your downloads and open it.

New Requirements and Clarifications
-----------------------------------

* Employees are assigned exactly one mentor who helps them with any issues they may face. An employee may mentor more than one employee.

* My Back Pages has decided to implement an emergency response training program at the request of their insurance company:

* All staff are required to take a series of training classes on emergency procedures. Classes have an ID, a title, and a training level.

* Each class has one or more accompanying exams which must be passed. Each exam has an ID, a title, a max score, and a passing score. If the employee fails an exam, they must take the class again.

* The system must keep track of each time employees take a class or exam.

* My Back Pages sells used books as well as new ones. Each copy of a book has a condition, purchase price, sale price, date purchased, and date sold.

You will need to figure out what additional information is needed and explain your reasoning for any decisions you make. These should appear as a series of notes in the ERD document. Part of your grade will depend on how reasonable these decisions are and how well you explain them in the notes. Be aware that creating an ERD is an art rather than an exact science. In more complex applications, there are often several alternative ways information could be represented. There is no single "correct" answer. Your goal is to come up with an ERD that contains the data in such a way that useful information could be retrieved. Sometimes, you have information about the system that simply cannot be represented in an ERD but would have to be implemented later by a programmed business rule. Example: "Students must pay fees before they take the class." The point is that you need to include sufficient information that someone who knows how to read an ERD can understand your design and why you chose to design it that way. An obvious example is whether or not to use an ISA relationship: both choices may well be okay, but you should explain why you chose to use one or not.

Finally, you will convert your ERD to a logical model and include the conversion as part of your submission.

Submitting the Assignment
-------------------------

* This is an individual assignment. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment. All work must be your own.

* Your ERD document and Conversion document format must be .doc, .docx, .pdf, or .jpg. No hand-drawn or hand-written submissions will be accepted.

* The ERD should include all entities, attributes, relationships, cardinality constraints, and notes explaining your decisions.

* Submit the ERD document to Canvas. Also submit your notes/discussion and your Conversion.

* Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the AIso will not be able to grade it and you will receive a grade of 0.

* No late submissions will be accepted. Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

----------------
Grading Criteria

----------------

The ERD (35 points) will be graded on the following basis:

* Are all entities correctly identified and typed as strong or weak? (6 points)

* Are the relationships between the entities correctly identified? (6 points)

* Are the attributes of each entity correctly identified and categorized? (6 points)

* Are all cardinality constraints correctly identified? (4 points)

* Is the ERD in a clear, easy-to-read layout? (3 points)

* In this extension of the assignment, you included two new concepts - book copies, and a mentoring relationship. For each of these two new concepts, address the following questions in your ERD notes:

* What design alternatives did you consider? (3 points)

* Did you make reasonable decisions? (3 points)

* Does your ERD accurately match the decisions you made? (4 points)

The logical model (15 points) will be graded on the following basis:

* Is your conversion an accurate representation of the ERD you submitted?

* Are all tables properly identified? (5 points)

* Are all attributes correctly identified in each table? (5 points)

* Are all keys correctly indicated? (5 points)

 Your Task
----------

What should my best presentation be about?

So many times, in so many situations, you will hear a seemingly easy statement/prompt: "So, Tell Me About Yourself". It many be in an interview (for a job, internship or scholarship), or by a colleague or even by your significant other's parents. Knowing how you want to present yourself as well as your strengths and your weaknesses can help you in being prepared to answer this question thoroughly - and that can make all the difference.  

You can include some of these in your presentation / please don't answer all of them:

* Who are you?

* What's your background?

* What have been your struggles?

* What are your accomplishments?

Make it personal, you could include

* a "thing" you did or are an expert in;

* a project you undertook and the challenges you faced (and maybe how you overcame them);

* a topic you find genuinely interesting and inspiring and want us to tell about;

* an introduction of yourself and what your career aspirations are;

* an interesting hobby of yours, for example (fishing, hiking, gaming, sports, chess, boccia ball);

* a pitch of an idea or project you did, or would like to engage with;

* an experience, for instance, a recent trip of yours. 

As long as this is YOUR presentation, meaning you have created and edited it, you may use it. 

How many slides?

* Exactly 5 slides. No more. No less.

How much time?

* 4 minutes max.

* See that you do not finish earlier than 2.5 min.

What format should the presentation be in?

* I am asking for a PDF submission this time.

* That means you need to create a PDF printout of your presentation and submit that pdf as an attachment in this Canvas Discussion. 

* That also means you can't rely on transitions, videos, sound or other slide/deck animations. 

 

-----------
 Submission

Purpose 
--------

The purpose of this discussion is for teams to submit their relational model and 5 possible data queries that could be run on the data model  instructors. This exercise will help teams determine what SELECT queries they will be required to create as part of their Final Project

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

3. Implement the Logical Schema in a Relational Model (SQL)

4. Populate a Relational Database with Data using SQL

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

-----
 Task
-----

Your task as a team is to submit the following items for your final project:

* Your final project relational model with each table on a separate line. Indicate foreign keys by underlining them and adding a ^ after the attribute.

* Your current ERD so that the graders know the exact ERD you are converting. If you find that you needed to make changes to your ERD based on your ideas for queries, you should include some text pointing out the changes in the ERD compared to the one you submitted in Step 2.

After consulting with your mentor:

* Include a brief description of what the focus of your system will be. Here is an example for a project on a meal delivery service:

“The focus of our system is to record information about delivery drivers and meals ordered for the company's Payroll Department. The system will keep track of orders placed by customers and which delivery driver delivered the order. The system will also keep track of payments made by customers which can then be used to calculate the amount a driver made on an order.”

* Submit a description of 5 possible queries that you might create. Each query must:

*

* Involve data from multiple tables

* Be reasonably used in the organization modeled. 

* Clearly indicate what data should be returned

* Indicate the parameters that determine which instances of the data should be returned.

* For example:  "Find all of the full names and phone numbers of customers who attended an event in a specified month."

This is a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Your mentor will verify with you during lab whether all members made equal contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade accordingly.

* Submit a single .doc, .docx, or .pdf document with all parts of the assignment. Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

* Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

--------------
Grading Rubric

--------------

The logical data model will be graded on the following basis:

* Does the logical conversion correctly follow the ERD that was submitted?

* Are all tables correctly identified?

* Are the attributes for each table correctly identified?

* Are all primary and foreign keys correctly identified and indicated?

The data queries will be graded on the following basis. The group clearly identifies 5 substantively unique data queries that:

* Can be run on the data model specified.

* Require data from more than one table.

* Clearly specify the data to be returned

* Clearly specify the parameters that determine which data is returned.

19-20 points - Excellent work. Your team is ready to continue to the next step.

16-18 points - A good effort. Your mentor will indicate minor changes that you should make before proceeding to the next step

less than 15 points - Serious inadequacies. You need to contact your mentor and arrange to resubmit this assignment with the necessary changes before proceeding to the next step. Your grade on this assignment will be the average of your original grade and the grade on your re-submission.

---------
 Purpose 
---------

The purpose of this project step is for teams to create their Final Project database based on the relational model turned in for Project Step 3 and populate it with sufficient data to demonstrate that their queries work correctly.

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

4. Populate a Relational Database with Data using SQL

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

------
 Task 
------

Your team task is to develop a single .sql script that:

* Creates all of the tables in your logical model (CREATE TABLE statements)

* Populates each table with enough data to show that the queries you turned in for Project Step 3 actually work as intended. (INSERT statements)

Data requirements:

* You need to create sufficient data to demonstrate that your design works and that your queries return the appropriate data.

* A general rule of thumb is at least 10 rows per table based on strong entities (the "base" tables), but consult with your mentor to make sure your data is sufficient. In particular, make sure that you are inserting lots of data for the transaction table(s) in your system.

* Do not simply insert multiple identical rows—for example, the same student living in the same room multiple times. This will result in a zero grade for this part of the project. The data should be believable.

* Include any other data that is necessary for your system to function. Remember you are creating it to sell the system to a client so it should look as realistic as possible.

You may use [Mockaroo] (https://www.mockaroo.com/) or a similar data generation service to help create your data.

See the video below for a tutorial on how to use Mockaroo:

--------------------------
 Submitting the Assignment
--------------------------

This is a team assignment that is part of the Final Project assignment group. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Percentages for participation can be used for members. 

Submit a single .sql script file with both parts of the assignment. Once you have submitted, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

---------------
 Grading Rubric

---------------

The script will be graded on the following basis:

* Are all tables correctly created based on the ERD and logical model submitted in Project Step 3?

* Are all primary and foreign keys correctly identified with constraints?

* Are the datatypes used for each attribute appropriate?

* Is there sufficient data populating the tables to run the queries?

* Does the data meet the requirements outlined above for the  assignment?

19-20 points - Excellent work. Your team is ready to continue to the next step.

16-18 points - A good effort. Your mentor will indicate minor changes that you should make before proceeding to the next step

less than 15 points - Serious inadequacies. You need to contact your mentor and arrange to resubmit this assignment with the necessary changes before proceeding to the next step. Your grade on this assignment will be the average of your original grade and the grade on your re-submission.

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

------
 Task 
------

Your team task is to write detailed specs for your five SELECT queries. Note that your final list of queries may require you go back and make changes to your database design and build steps.

 Purpose 
---------

The purpose of this discussion is for teams to create the SQL queries required by their Final Project and that were identified in [PROJECT | Step 5a: Finalizing the SELECT Queries] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/assignments/15648856) as updated by their mentor and/or instructor.

This activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:

5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output data.

------
 Task 
------

Your team task is to develop a single .sql script that contains the complete SQL SELECT queries for all queries identified in [ PROJECT | Step 3: Logical Schema & SELECT Query Ideas ] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/assignments/15648851)as updated by your mentor and/or instructor.

At this point you will have to hard code some of the queries. Once you get your web front end working in the final step, the user will be able to select values that can be inserted into your queries via an input variable.

Please add comments to your MySQL script explaining where you plan to replace a hard-coded value with a variable. For example: "This query specifies Briscoe Quad. In the final version, the user will be able to specify the dorm in question."

--------------------------

---------------

This assignment will be graded on the following basis:

* Is the assignment turned in as a single .sql script? If not, a 20 point penalty will be assessed to the assignment.

* Does the query run in MYSQL without errors?

* Does the query accomplish what is asked without errors?

9-10 points - Excellent work. Your team is ready to continue to the next step.

7-8 points - A good effort. Your mentor will indicate minor changes that you should make before proceeding to the next step

less than 7 points - Serious inadequacies. You need to contact your mentor and arrange to resubmit this assignment with the necessary changes before proceeding to the next step. Your grade on this assignment will be the average of your original grade and the grade on your re-submission.

----------
 Your Task
----------

Critically review & analyze your presentation performance using the video recording. Utilize your own thoughts and the silent feedback from your audience to set goals for continuous improvement in the three areas of slide design, speaker delivery, and audience engagement.

Please do not look at your silent feedback BEFORE you have watched your own presentation.

-----
Steps
-----

Step 1: Review Your Presentation Recording, critique yourself, and take notes while watching your own talk. 

Access the recording of your presentation. Watch your presentation with a critical eye, paying attention to both verbal and non-verbal aspects. 

While watching your presentation, take down notes observing three categories: that make a great presentation:

*

* Speaker: How was your speech, your body language and gestures? Did you move throughout the room or did you remain static, did you look at the audience, did you talk too fast or too slow?

* Audience: Did you have an opener or closer and if so, how did you feel about it? Did you tell a story in between? Was the story good? Why? Could you have done a better job? How? Did the audience engage with you and did you engage with them? 

* Slides: Was the content comprehensible, did it make sense, could one understand it when engaging with it for the first time? Were the slides readable, could one see what you tried to show? Did the presentation look professional? Why? Why not?

Step 2: Self-Assessment of Your Presentation regarding your Strengths and Weaknesses 

Using your notes, reflect on your own presentation performance, identify and summarize 2-3 strengths and 2-3 weaknesses you could observe.

Write down specific areas (e.g., Speaker: I am talking to fast, I need to pace myself and take breaks.) and details you believe require improvement.

Step 3: Review the Audience Feedback of Your Presentation.

Open up the silent feedback envelope you have received and read the notes.

Step 4: Comparative Analysis of your self-assessment with the audience assessment 

Compare your self-assessment with the feedback received from your audience and note any similarities or discrepancies between your own assessment and their feedback. Consider the value of external perspectives in identifying areas for improvement, in contrast, to your self-assessment. 

Step 5: 3 Actionable Goals for Improvement

Based on the feedback and self-assessment, set 3 goals for improvement. These goals should be specific, actionable goals for improvement placed in each of the three categories (slides, speaker, and audience).

Actionable means, that you will describe what you would do/change to reach your goal. An Example Goal for the Slides category could state that the goal is to have less text-dense slides and better visuals which can be reached by utilizing bullet points and images

Slides: Minimize Text Density and Increase Visual Appeal

* Limit text on each slide to key points or concise statements.

* Utilize bullet points or visual cues to convey information effectively.

 

-----------
 Submission
-----------

Submission: Submit a PDF document containing a narrative, which covers:

* Step 2: Your Self-Assessment of Your Talk including 2-3 strengths and 2-3 weaknesses you have identified. 

* Step 4: A comparative analysis of your self-assessment against the peer assessment discussing similarities and discrepancies (e.g., did you learn something from the peer feedback that you have not considered in your own review or vice-versa?);

* Step 5: Use the comparative analysis to create 3 Actionable Goals for Improvement describing what you want to improve and how you plan to improve it. 

Note: This assignment aims to foster self-reflection and targeted improvement. Utilize the feedback as a valuable resource for honing your presentation skills. There is no minimum word count or expectation for this assignment.

 Purpose 
---------

The purpose of this assignment is to assemble and polish the final version of all the components of your project.

This activity aligns with all six of the I308 Course Outcomes.

----
Task
----

Your team Final Project task is to finish your final project by turning in a web-based interface for your queries as well as the final version of the documents you created in the various project steps.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Final versions of your ERD and Conversion that represent the database as you actually built it. (teamxxERD.pdf)

* A MySQL script containing the final version of the code that you wrote to create your database tables and populate them with data. (teamxxBuild.sql)

* A file containing your MySQL code for of all the SELECT statements.(teamxxSELECT.sql)

* A file containing all the HTML and PHP code that you used to create and run your web page(s). There will be several scripts, and they must be in a zip file called teamxxCODE.zip.

* A file that describes exactly what each of your queries does and suggests input to provide positive and negative test to demonstrate that it works. If you did any "special" features, this file should also describe what they are and how you implemented them. (teamxxNOTES.pdf)

* The link to the home page of your project. This should be in the text area of the submission.

Ten of the 130 points for this assignment will be awarded based on any "special features" you have successfully implemented in your project. Generally, these are things that we talked about in class but that you did not get to implement in any of the individual or team assignments. The following is a list of some ideas; you should discuss these or any other ideas you might have with your mentor and/or instructor. Points indicated are for full, successful implementation of the feature, not just for attempting it. Note that you cannot attempt more than 10 points total--i.e., attempt 20 points and do them all badly in hopes of getting 10 points of partial credit.

* Security: Setting up Login/Password security based on a table in your database (4 points) with encrypted passwords (2 points). Then incorporating a PHP session (4 points).

* Creating and using a view (4 points). The view must have a sensible purpose--i.e., be useful.

* Having a Return button on the query results pages that takes the user back to the main project page. (2 points)

* Using input types other than the basic text and dropdowns where they make sense. (1 point each, up to 4 points max)

* Giving user options to order tailor query results by incorporating choices that can be inserted into the executed MySQL query--for example,sorting or limiting the output (2 points each, up to 4 points max)

* Having a "2-level" query. For example, the main query returns a list of most popular menu items. The user can then select one of these and see details of all purchases of that item. (8 points)

* If you have other ideas for special features, discuss these with your mentor or instructor.

 

--------------------------
Submitting Your Assignment
--------------------------

This is a team assignment that is part of the Final Project assignment group. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed.

Once you have submitted, check that your links open correctly from Canvas.

Absolutely no late submissions will be accepted. Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.

Checklist of files to submit to Canvas:
---------------------------------------

* teamxxERD.pdf

* teamxxBUILD.sql

* teamxxSELECT.sql

* teamXX.CODEzip

* teamxxNOTES.pdf

Additionally, the url for your project's main page must appear in the text area of the assignment submission.

---------------
 Grading Rubric

---------------

Your team mentor will be the primary grader for your project. It will also be graded independently by a second TA who has not been involved with your team during the semester. Your instructors will check the range of grades to ensure that the standard is consistent throughout all teams and sections.

Your project will first be graded on product quality, and by default, all members of a team will receive the same grade. However, adjustments may be made for individuals who have contributed significantly more or less to the project. Each team member must submit the Team Contribution Evaluation, and this may be used, in conjunction with your mentor's or instructor's interactions with the team, to make adjustments to individual grades.

This assignment will be graded for product quality on the following basis: [Team Project Grading Rubric.xlsx] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166384444?wrap=1)
