DESCRIPTION:----------------------------------------------\nWeek 1 - Emotio
 nal Intelligence and Leadership\n-----------------------------------------
 -----\n\n* Explain the research connecting emotional intelligence to leade
 rship and team effectiveness\n\n* List and define elements of emotional in
 telligence\n\n* Understand the prevalence of mental health challenges\n\n-
 --------------------------------\nEmotional Intelligence and BlueEQ\n-----
 ----------------------------\n\nThis semester\, you will take an assessmen
 t called Blue EQ. This assessment will help you identify your strengths an
 d areas of growth. Throughout the semester we will gain an understanding o
 f the elements in the Blue EQ assessment and how you can improve your emot
 ional intelligence to become a stronger leader. Some of these concepts see
 m like common sense - you may read through the concepts and think\, "I kno
 w that." The question I'd like you to consider is\, "Do I do that?...and a
 nd do I do it well?" Knowledge does not equate to regular practice in our 
 lives. Each of us can improve\, grow\, and develop.\n\nWhy is Emotional In
 telligence Important?\n\n* "If your emotional abilities aren't in hand\, i
 f you don't have self-awareness\, if you are not able to manage your distr
 essing emotions\, if you can't have empathy and have effective relationshi
 ps\, then no matter how smart you are\, you are not going to get very far.
 " ~ Daniel Goleman\n\n* "Seventy-five percent of careers are derailed 
 for reasons related to emotional competencies\, including inability to han
 dle interpersonal problems\; unsatisfactory team leadership during times o
 f difficulty or conflict\; or inability to adapt to change or elicit trust
 ." ~ Center for Creative Leadership\n\nRead about Goleman's Components of
  Emotional Intelligence\n\nIn Compass 3\, we look at leadership and virtua
 l teaming through the lens of Emotional Intelligence.  Emotional Intellig
 ence (or EI) is “the other kind of smart” as Travis Bradberry calls it
  (co-author of Emotional Intelligence 2.0). It’s that something in each 
 of us that is a bit intangible.\n\nIt affects how we manage behavior\, nav
 igate social complexities\, and make personal decisions.\n\n[Daniel Golema
 n.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168047258/preview
 )\n\nThe term was popularized by Daniel Goleman in 1995 and grabbed the at
 tention of the business world after his study of 200 large\, global compan
 ies established that truly effective leaders were distinguished by a high 
 degree of EI. Goleman outlined 4 areas of emotional intelligence. In this 
 course\, we use an instrument called Blue EQ. Blue EQ relates to much of G
 oleman's work but some of the terms are framed differently. \n\nWhat we u
 se: Blue EQ\n\nOur course is framed around the five Blue EQ competencies:
  \n\n* Self-Regard\n\n* Self-Awareness\n\n* Self-Control\n\n* Social Effe
 ctiveness\n\n* Social Perception\n\nBuilding your Emotional Intelligence i
 s the surest way I know of growing as a leader. \n\n[img_5-skills-5-dimen
 sions.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168047743/pre
 view)\n\nJust take a look at the research: \n\n[87% of leaders who get bo
 nues have high EQ.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/1
 68047127/preview)\n\nEmotional Intelligence wins bonuses! \n\n* 87% of  
 the emotionally intelligent division heads at a global food and beverage c
 ompany placed in the top third for annual salary bonuses because their div
 isions out performed yearly revenue targets by 15-20% in contrast to execs
  who lacked emotional intelligence who were rarely rated as outstanding in
  their reviews.\n\nThe US Air Force started selecting recruiters who had a
  high level of emotional intelligence. The result? A three-fold increase i
 n success and a savings of nearly 3 million annually. And at L’Oreal (an
  organization about as different from the Air Force as you can get!) —th
 e salespeople selected for their EI competency\, outsold their counterpart
 s by $91\,000 in the very first year.\n\n[US Air Force EI stats.jpg] (http
 s://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168046891/preview)\n\n[Consul
 ting firm EI Stats.jpg] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/
 168046996/preview)\n\nAt a multi-national consulting firm\, leaders with h
 igh EQ (Emotional Quotient)\, delivered $1.2 million more profit from thei
 r accounts than did other partners. \n\n \n\nDoes EQ count as much as go
 od ol' IQ?\n\nSo the research starts to stack up\, but in the end\, does E
 Q count as much as good old IQ? Won’t your technical skills always be mo
 re important than your people skills? Especially in the business world?  
 You might be surprised…\n\nIn research at an accounting firm\, the partn
 ers with social skills (that’s an EI competency) added 110%  more incre
 mental profit while those with really strong  analytical reasoning abilit
 ies added just 50% incremental profit. To be blunt: EQ trumps IQ for leade
 rs. Our analytical skills are important but not AS important as self-aware
 ness\, self-management\, empathy\, and building relationships. \n\n[EQ tr
 umps IQ] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2200271/files/168047252/downl
 oad?wrap=1)\n\nSo\, how strong do you think your Emotional Intelligence sk
 ills are?\n\nAs you consider this\, you should know that in research compa
 ring self-assessment to assessments by others\, ALL leaders tend to overes
 timate their EI strength. \n\nThe top performing leaders\, overestimate t
 heir ability in at least one category and less effective leaders overestim
 ate in all quadrants!\n\n* You may remember in Compass 1 when we looked at
  your skills section from CareerLeader\, we had you think of examples that
  proved that you had a skill\, since it was human nature to overestimate o
 ur skills at times\n\n* The same thing can happen with your Emotional Quot
 ient. We may not be quite as good at these things as we think we are.  Bu
 t Compass 3 is your chance to enhance your Emotional Quotient AND your lea
 dership. \n\nMy hope for you going forward in this class\n\nI hope I’ve
  made a compelling case for pouring some of your energy\, some of your att
 ention\, and some of your heart in to becoming an emotionally intelligent 
 leader and team member this semester.

  Throughout the semester we will gain an understanding of the elements in 
 the Blue EQ assessment and how you can <strong>improve your emotional inte

  like common sense - you may read through the concepts and think\, "I know
  that." The question I'd like you to <strong>consider </strong>is\, <stron
 g>"Do I do that?...and and do I do it well?"</strong> Knowledge does not e
 quate to regular practice in our lives. Each of us can improve\, grow\, an

DESCRIPTION:------------------\n Week 1 - Overview\n------------------\n\n
 On this page there are a couple of videos to watch\, you'll take a Quick C
 heck Quiz\, and you'll see the due dates for the week.\n\nIn the rest of t

 al Intelligence\, a page covering mental health statistics\, take a couple
  of assessments\, and participate in a Discussion.\n\n---------------\nTim
 e Management\n---------------\n\nTime management is a very useful skill fo
 r your time at Kelley (especially if you're in ICore)! While some of us ar
 e better at this than others\, time management can become more complicated
  when dealing with an online course as they require a tad bit more effort 
 in time management. If you can master time management\, you will have a gr
 eat skill for life. \n\nClick the image to the right to watch a short vid
 eo (3m 33 sec) about time management.\n\n \n\n \n\nDisclaimer: The video
  mentions that managing your time puts your stress level "at a normal stat
 e." Please note that while time management can indeed reduce stress\, if y
 ou're dealing with anxiety\, you will likely need additional strategies to
  manage your anxiety.\n\n-------\nTo Do's\n-------\n\n* Read the [Syllabu

 ate by a few days. \n\nNEXT WEEK: I will post an asynchronous (pre-record
 ed) Orientation session by Tuesday\, January 16 at 1pm. This session will 
 contain a high-level overview of the progression of the course and its del
 iverables. We will also go over how the team meetings and subsequent team 
 submissions will work. Since this is an online course\, it's important to 
 watch this orientation to help you get started and have a successful team 
 experience in Compass 3. \n\n----------------------------------\nLearning
  Outcomes for This Module \n----------------------------------\n\n* Have 
 a clear grasp of the course requirements\, policies\, and what you persona

DESCRIPTION:-----------------------------------------\nWeek 2 - Leading Vir
 tual Teams QuickCheck\n-----------------------------------------\n\n​Bef
 ore you go further on this page\, reflect for a moment on any remote work 
 you have already done.\n\n* What worked well for you?\n\n* What did NOT wo
 rk well in your virtual interactions? \n\n-------------------------------
 -------------------\nRead and Watch to Prepare for Quick Check (30 pts)\n-
 -------------------------------------------------\n\nAs you read and watch
  the resources below:\n\n* Look for at least five virtual teaming best pra
 ctices you would like to integrate into your Compass 3 team (and any other
  teams you're on at Kelley) this semester.\n\n* Consider actions you can t
 ake before\, during\, and after a meeting to increase your team productivi
 ty and performance. \n\n* Write your five action items in your notes to d
 iscuss in your first team meeting. \n\nResources on Virtual Teaming\n\nPl
 ease watch and read the resources below before starting the Quick Check qu
 iz.\n\n​\n\nBuilding Trust\n\nThe video to the left is from the Building
  Trust LinkedIn Learning course created by Professor Brenda Bailey-Hughes 
 (a former Compass 3 professor) for the LinkedIn Learning Library. It has o
 ver 660\,000 views!\n\nIn this 1ish-minute video you'll see a virtual team
  use eight different best practices.\n\nConsider what these eight strategi
 es might look like if you integrated them into your Compass 3 team.  \n\
 nTo recap the 8 strategies:\n\n* Communicate on a variety of topics (some 
 social\, some work)\n\n* Share time-zone burden (not an issue for your tea
 ms this semester!)\n\n* Standardize communication procedures (have a consi
 stent way to join meetings\, message one another\, etc.)\n\n* Create a vir
 tual team space for project documents\n\n* Clarify goals\, roles\, and exp
 ectations (important with any team but even more so when the team meets vi
 rtually and can easily slip into a pattern of mistrust)\n\n* Be a connecto
 r (help people on the team get to know one another better)\n\n* Rotate pow
 er\n\n* Communicate frequently\n\nLeading Virtual Teams: Best Practice Ins
 ights\n\nClick on the image to the right to read a case study on virtual t
 eaming by Deloitte.\n\nFrom the case:\n"Recent Australian research shows t
 hat leading effective virtual teams does not require a huge investment in 
 technology\, but it does require strategies which are fit for purpose and 
 not a carbon copy of face-to-face leadership practices. Intriguingly\, vir
 tual teams may experience higher levels of individual contribution and div
 erse thinking arising from chat\, Yammer and polling technology."\n\nBy Ju

 other things):\n\n"As a co-worker wisely pointed out to me — emojis are 
 the emotions of a remote team."\n\nClick on the image to the left to read 
 more and see if it changes your mind!\n\n"Project Aristotle"\n\n"Much of t
 he work done at Google\, and in many organizations\, is done collaborative
 ly by teams. The team is the molecular unit where real production happens\
 , where innovative ideas are conceived and tested\, and where employees ex
 perience most of their work. But it’s also where interpersonal issues\, 
 ill-suited skill sets\, and unclear group goals can hinder productivity an
 d cause friction.\n\nFollowing the success of [Google’s Project Oxygen 
 research] (https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-google-sold-its-engineers-on-manage
 ment) (HBR article) where the People Analytics team studied [what makes a
  great manager] (https://rework.withgoogle.com/jp/guides/understanding-tea
 m-effectiveness#introduction)\, Google researchers applied a similar metho
 d to discover the secrets of effective teams at Google. Code-named Project
  Aristotle - a tribute to Aristotle’s quote\, "the whole is greater than
  the sum of its parts" (as the Google researchers believed employees can d
 o more working together than alone) - the goal was to answer the question:
  “What makes a team effective at Google?” (emphasis mine)\n\n**This wa
 s a study conducted by Google on what makes teams (in person or virtual) e
 ffective. We will visit this idea again later in the semester as we approa
 ch the Social Effectiveness Case.\n\n[unnamed.png] (https://iu.instructure

DESCRIPTION:The following is an in-class activity that we should complete i
 n 20 minutes and is equivalent to attendance for the day.\n\nCompare gener
 ated goals and objectives for your lesson ideas using two different large 
 language models.  Learn about the hierarchy of goals\, objectives\, and t
 asks in organizing a learning program.\n\nStep 1: make a copy of the [Goog
 le Colab.] (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wPgWNm-MrwhEOwdTcuS7g
 deZcrjjNxmg?usp=sharing) Note: we will walk through each cell of this code
  together for this activity.\n\nStep 2: brainstorm a list of technologies\
 , topics\, facts\, and activities you would like in your lessons (do this 
 on your own first and then with your group)\n\nStep 3: add this list to th
 e Google Colab variable materials.\n\nStep 4: use the gpt4 model and run t
 he code that will generate a list of learning goals\n\nStep 5: read throug
 h these goals and choose 3 that are most appropriate or interesting for yo
 u and put those in variable goal1\, goal2\, and goal3.\n\nStep 6: run the 
 code to generate learning objectives\n\nStep 7: choose one objective and c
 opy it into objective variable.  Note: if the text takes up more than one
  line\, you may have to remove the line break.\n\nStep 8: run the code to 
 generate a list of tasks\n\nStep 9: choose a task and generate an outline 
 for slides and use of class time\n\nStep 10: generate a report in markdown
  format.  Copy it into a text editor and save it as "gpt4-<your lastname>
 .md"\n\nStep 11 (optional): repeat this process using a faster and much le
 ss expensive model\, gpt-3.5-turbo\n\nStep 12: Use this material as a reso
 urce for brainstorming lesson plan ideas with your group.

DESCRIPTION:----------------------------------------\nWeek 2 - CoStudy Goal
  Setting Assignment\n----------------------------------------\n\nThis seme
 ster CoStudy will be our mechanism for peer evaluation and reflection duri
 ng the team meetings portion of the course. \n\n-------------------------
 -------\nCoStudy Introduction and Details\n-------------------------------
 -\n\nCoStudy provides us a way to anonymously assess ourselves and our tea
 m lead each week.  \n\nOverview of how we'll use it this semester\n\n* W
 e start with a goal-setting assignment (this one!) for you to consider how
  you'd like to engage with your team.\n\n* After each team meeting\, the 
 Team Lead will do a self-assessment and the team members will assess the l
 eader. Each should not take more than 20 minutes to complete.\n\n* You'll
  have one check-in survey mid-way through the semester. This survey is for
  you to have an opportunity to communicate with your team and yourself abo
 ut what is going well and what needs to improve with your team.\n\n* You w
 ill receive an email when assessments become available on CoStudy and 24 h
 ours before each assessment is due. \n\nThis week's assignment\n\nThis we
 ek you will log into Costudy and complete the initial goal setting assessm
 ent.\n\n* Set up your account in CoStudy by clicking on [THIS LINK.] (http
 ://platform.costudy.co/join)\n\n* Use this code: kqqtde.\n\n* Enter your F
 irst and Last Name\, your @iu.edu email\, a password you can remember\, an
 d select your designated team.\n\n* It is very important that you select t
 he correct team number.\n\n* You can find your Team Number in Canvas. Clic
 k on "People" (on the left) and then "Teams" along the top left of your sc
 reen\n\nAfter you've set up your account\, you will receive announcements 
 when assessments become available and reminders 24 hours before they are d
 ue.\n\nIMPORTANT!!!  Once the due date has passed\, the assessment will b
 e available for one day. Then it closes permanently.\n\n* If you forget to
  fill out Costudy by the due date\, you will have one day to complete for 
 a 20% deduction\n\n* After that\, there is no option to reopen the assessm
 ent.\n\n \n\nYou do NOT need to enter anything into this assignment to re
 ceive credit. I will run a report directly from the CoStudy Platform that 
 provides me with all the feedback you enter. \n\n

 lop these into more comprehensive lesson plans. Each plan should include a
 t minimum: an aim\, the learning outcomes\, the necessary resources\, incl
 uding any technology tools\, the teaching activities\, and methods of asse
 ssment.\n\n*\n\nExplore Technologies: Research and explore various technol
 ogies that could enhance your lesson plans and overall program. These coul
 d be digital tools for presenting information\, platforms for collaborativ
 e work\, or helpful software for executing lessons. Include your technolog
 ical choices and their supporting justifications in your program proposal.
 \n\n*\n\nTest Your Lessons: Before seeking feedback from others\, test you
 r lessons among your group. Roles can be assigned for this task: one or tw
 o students can act as teachers to lead the lesson\, while the rest act as 
 students to critically engage with the content. Make revisions as necessar
 y based on the insights gained during this simulation.\n\n*\n\nFeedback fr
 om Peers: Present your two developed and tested lesson plans to other grou
 ps for feedback. Use their insights to refine and improve your plans furth
 er.\n\n*\n\nWriting a Cover Letter: In a one page cover letter\, explain t
 he overall learning goals\, objectives\, and vision of your educational pr
 ogram. Include details on how the chosen technologies will enhance the lea

 t you learned from your tests. Attach the two example lesson plans.\n\n*\n
 \nPresentation: Present your refined and tested lesson plans along with yo
 ur cover letter to the whole class. This presentation should encapsulate y
 our entire process — from initial brainstorming\, the technology explora
 tion process\, feedback incorporation\, up to the final iterations of your
  lesson plans.

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this assignment you and you
 r team will learn more about how a basic Entity-Relationship Diagram is cr
 eated from system requirements.\n\nThis assignment aligns with the followi
 ng I308 course learning outcome:\n\n*\n\n* Analyze requirements and solici
 t information to design a Conceptual Schema using an Entity Relationship D
 iagram (ERD).\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nYour task as a team is to create 
 an ERD for WeFlyU Airport\, a local airport that maintains a fleet of smal
 l planes. The information below was given by the airport's manager.\n\n* E
 very airplane has a registration number\, crew size\, and year built\, and
  each airplane is of a specific model.\n\n* The airport accommodates a n
 umber of airplane models\, and each model is identified by a model number(
 e.g.\, DC-10) and has a capacity\, a weight\, dimensions (length\, wingspa
 n\, height)\, max range\, and max speed.\n\n* A number of technicians work
  at the airport. You need to store the name\, SSN\, address\, email\, and 
 salary of each technician. Each technician is an expert on one or more pla
 ne model(s)\, and his or her expertise may overlap with that of other tech
 nicians.  This information about technicians must also be recorded.\n\n* 
 Traffic controllers must have an annual medical examination. For each traf
 fic controller\, you must store the date of the most recent exam.\n\n* All
  airport employees (including technicians) contribute to the company pensi
 on plan.  You must store the retirement account number of each employee. 
 You can assume that each employee is uniquely identified by his or her soc
 ial security number.\n\n* The airport has a number of tests that are use
 d periodically to ensure that airplanes are still airworthy. Each test h
 as a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test number\, a name\, and a
  maximum possible score.\n\n* The FAA requires the airport to keep track 
 of each time a given airplane is tested by a given technician using a give
 n test. For each testing event\, the information needed is the date\, the 
 number of hours the technician spent doing the test\, and the score that t
 he airplane received on the test. \n\n--------------------\nSubmitting Yo
 ur Work\n--------------------\n\nThis is a team assignment. Let your mento
 r know if any team member did not contribute to this assignment.\n\nRefer 
 to this video for help with creating a digital ERD using draw.io\, our req
 uired way for you to create ERDs in this course:\n\n \n\n* Your ERD docum
 ent format must be a PNG file. No hand-drawn submissions will be accepted.
  If there is any difficulty in reading it may cause you to lose points.\n\
 n* Submit the ERD document to Canvas.\n\n* The ERD should include all enti
 ties\, attributes\, and relationships. You do NOT need to include cardinal
 ity constraints.\n\n* Once you have submitted\, check that your document o
 pens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they 
 are using\, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% 
 of your total score.\n\n* NOTE: The next assignment builds on this ERD\, a
 nd we provide a solution to this assignment as a starting point. Therefore
  absolutely no late submissions will be allowed for this assignment.\n\n* 
 Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra ti
 me to make a submission.\n\n--------------\nGrading Rubric\n\n------------
 --\n\nThe ERD will be graded on the following basis:\n\n* Are all entities
  correctly identified and typed as strong or weak? (20 points)\n\n* Are th
 e relationships between the entities correctly identified? (10 points)\n\n
 * Are the attributes of each entity correctly identified and categorized? 
 (15 points)\n\n* Is the ERD in a clear\, easy-to-read layout? (5 points)\n
 \nOther sources may use different conventions for ERD symbols and design. 
 If your ERD does not follow the style taught in this course\, you will be 
 required to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.

 qFwa9j7lEIwB90SIMHPwuyfJ_So1KVcBHg?e=bbZbw5) carefully. This document cont
 ains:\n\n* How to create and share an invitation for a Zoom meeting\n\n* B
 E SURE TO LOG INTO zoom.iu.edu. This gives you unlimited time on Zoom. If 
 you use the free version of Zoom\, you'll only have 40 minutes\, which isn
 't enough time.\n\n* If you're in the Zoom App and it asks you to log in\,
  be sure to click "Sign in using SSO" at the bottom of the sign on page. T
 hat will re-route you to the IU sign on.\n\n* Support numbers if you have 
 trouble\n\n* Several things you need to be sure to do during the meeting (

 90SIMHPwuyfJ_So1KVcBHg?e=bbZbw5).\n\nAsynchronous Lab - will be posted her
 e by Tuesday at 1pm\n\nWhile the recording is ~40 minutes\, your meeting 
 will likely run longer because you'll be playing the Stress Tolerance vide
 o and you will be leading your teams through the exercises I only describe
 d. \n\n* To know you're doing a thorough job\, the meeting should be at l
 east 60 minutes. Less than that is an indication that you didn't fully cov
 er the content.\n\nPowerPoint Slide Deck to use for your meeting: [Self Co
 ntrol_NW_stdt.pptx. ] (https://indiana-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/n

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nWhen looking at a situation ou
 t in the world it can feel like what we are looking at is just a haphazard
  collection of objects. The purpose of this assignment is to practice gett
 ing in the mindset of thinking about a situation in terms of how things ca
 n be grouped together\, what's relevant\, and what aspects of those things
  and their interactions are important to us.\n\n---------\nYour Task\n\n--
 -------\n\nYour task is to analyze the scene depicted in the attached pict
 ure (from the Where's Waldo series) and answer some questions about it as 
 detailed in the specifications below.\n\n[Waldo Image] (https://iu.instruc
 ture.com/courses/2204569/files/169329151?wrap=1)\n\n--------------\nSpecif
 ications\n--------------\n\n \n\nSpecification\n\nNotes\n\nIdentify the g
 eneral theme of the page. (2 points)\n\nThe theme can be as short as a sin
 gle word\, but you should include some information on things in the page t
 hat lead you to identifying the theme.\n\nIdentify at least 4 categories o
 f things on the page. (4 points)\n\nEach category should have at least 3 m
 embers in the picture\n\nFor each of the 4 categories\, list at least 4 at

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this individual assignment\
 , you will build on the work you did in Assignment 2 to create a more comp
 lex conceptual schema (in this case an ERD).\n\nThis assignment aligns wit
 h the following I308 course learning outcomes:\n\n*\n\n* Analyze requireme
 nts and solicit information to design a Conceptual Schema using an Entity 
 Relationship Diagram (ERD).\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nIt is almost always
  the case that requirements are clarified\, refined\, expanded\, and even 
 changed during the design process\, often at the last minute. After presen
 ting our original ERD to the client\, we have found out more about the req
 uirements for the WeFlyU Airport system.\n\nIn this assignment\, you will:
 \n\n* Modify the ERD structure given below and make the necessary changes 
 to include the new requirements\n\n* Complete the ERD by adding the attrib
 utes from the original requirements along with all required cardinality co
 nstraints\n\nOriginal Requirements (Represented in the ERD below)\n-------
 ---------------------------------------------\n\n* Every airplane has a re
 gistration number\, crew size\, and year built\, and each airplane is of 
 a specific model.\n\n* The airport accommodates a number of airplane mode
 ls\, and each model is identified by a model number(e.g.\, DC-10) and has 
 a capacity\, a weight\, dimensions (length\, wingspan\, height)\, max rang
 e\, and max speed.\n\n* A number of technicians work at the airport. You n
 eed to store the name\, SSN\, address\, and email salary of each technicia
 n. Each technician is an expert on one or more plane model(s)\, and his or
  her expertise may overlap with that of other technicians.  This informat
 ion about technicians must also be recorded.\n\n* Traffic controllers must
  have an annual medical examination. For each traffic controller\, you mus
 t store the date of the most recent exam.\n\n* All company employees (incl
 uding mechanics) contribute to the company pension plan.  You must store 
 the retirement account number of each employee. You can assume that each e
 mployee is uniquely identified by his or her social security number.\n\n* 
 The airport has a number of tests that are used periodically to ensure t
 hat airplanes are still airworthy. Each test has a Federal Aviation Ad
 ministration (FAA) test number\, a name\, and a maximum possible score.\
 n\n* The FAA requires the airport to keep track of each time a given ai
 rplane is tested by a given technician using a given test. For each test
 ing event\, the information needed is the date\, the number of hours th
 e technician spent doing the test\, and the score that the airplane recei
 ved on the test. \n\nERD For Original Requirements\n---------------------
 --------\n\nThe ERD below shows a good solution to Part One. Please use th
 is as a starting point rather than using the version created by your team.
  This will ensure that all students start out from the same place and will
  make grading easier.\n\n[WeFlyU Image.PNG] (https://iu.instructure.com/co
 urses/2204569/files/166383622/preview)\n\n[This file] (https://iu.instruct
 ure.com/courses/2204569/files/166384069?wrap=1) is a draw.io file containi
 ng this ERD. You do not have to build the starting ERD yourself.\n\n------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ----------------\n\n* Click the link and choose to Download the file (Save
  File).\n\n* Open draw.io and choose Open Existing Diagram.\n\n* Find the 
 file among your downloads and open it.\n\nNew Requirements\n\n* Technician
 s perform repairs on airplanes as necessary and record the date\, start/fi
 nish time\, problem\, part numbers used\, resolution\, and cost.\n\n* The 
 airport needs to store the date and score for every medical exam given to 
 controllers for historical purposes.\n\n* All airplane flights in and out 
 of the airport must be recorded. Each time a specific airplane lands or ta
 kes off\, the following information must be recorded: time\, date\, which 
 controller authorized it\, runway number\, what plane it was\, and who was
  piloting the plane.\n\n* Pilot information must be recorded and consists 
 of an ID number\, full name\, address\, license number\, phone number\, da
 te of birth. Pilots are private citizens\, not employees of the airport. E
 ach pilot is certified to fly one or more models of airplanes.\n\n* Employ
 ees have multiple phone numbers.\n\n* For repairs\,  part information is 
 now stored in the system. Each part has a number\, manufacturer part numbe
 r\, description\, image\, cost\, and what model of airplane it can be used
  on.\n\nSubmitting Your Assignment\n--------------------------\n\n* This i
 s an individual assignment\n\n* Your ERD document format must be a .png or
  .jpg file.\n\n* No hand-drawn submissions will be accepted.\n\n* Submit t
 he ERD document to Canvas.\n\n* The ERD should include all entities\, attr
 ibutes\, relationships\, and cardinality constraints. For this assignment\
 , cardinality constraints are required.\n\n* Once you have submitted\, che
 ck that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it 
 from the computer they are using\, the graders will require you to resubmi
 t for a maximum of 50% of your total score.\n\n* Late penalties will be ap
 plied according to the schedule in the syllabus.\n\n--------------\nGradin
 g Rubric\n\n--------------\n\nThe ERD will be graded on the following basi
 s:\n\n* Are all entities correctly identified and typed as strong or weak?
  (12 points)\n\n* Are the relationships between the entities correctly ide
 ntified? (10 points)\n\n* Are the attributes of each entity correctly iden
 tified and categorized? (10 points)\n\n* Are all cardinality constraints c
 orrectly identified? (12 points)\n\n* Is the ERD in a clear\, easy-to-read
  layout? (6 points)\n\nIt is useful to include notes in an ERD. Sometimes 
 you may see more than one way that something could be implemented\, and yo
 u would want your grader to know that considered alternatives. More import
 antly (in the real world)\, there is often information in a project's spec
 s that cannot be captured in an ERD (or implemented in the resulting datab
 ase). Are notes included to explain the reasoning behind any decisions you
  made in situations where there seemed to alternative ways to represent th
 e information? Including notes may save you points that would otherwise ha
 ve been deducted.\n\nOther sources may use different conventions for ERD s
 ymbols and design. If your ERD does not follow the style taught in this co
 urse\, you will be required to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total
  score.

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this assignment you and you
 r team will learn more about how data requirements are analyzed and create
 d by generating a precise and complete set of data requirements for your f
 inal project idea. This is a common activity in the technology professiona
 l world and this assignment will help students prepare for roles in inform
 ation system design and development. You will also provide a list of three
  useful reports that could be produced from your system.\n\n[Here] (https:
 //iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/169534169?wrap=1) is an example
  of a fairly good set of data requirements based on a project we are not d
 oing this semester (a repair shop for phones\, tablets\, etc.). It should 
 give you an idea of the sort of thing we expect.\n\nThis assignment aligns
  with the following I308 course learning outcome:\n\n2. Analyze requiremen
 ts and solicit information to design a Conceptual Schema using an Entity R
 elationship Diagram (ERD).\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nYour task as a team 
 is to create a final set of data requirements for your final project. The 
 data requirements should be set out as a set of bullet points similar to t
 hose we have been giving you for the ERD exercises. You should make it cle
 ar what the strong entities will be and the relationships between them. Yo
 u must also include a separate list of 3 to 5 reports that could be genera
 ted from your proposed model that you think the client would find useful. 
 Make sure to discuss your ideas with your mentor and ensure their feedback
  is included.\n\nThis is a team assignment. Please make sure your team num
 ber and member names are listed. Only team member names that participated 
 should be included. Your mentor will verify with you whether all members m
 ade equal contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the
  team's grade accordingly.\n\n* Your requirements document format must be 
 .doc or .docx\n\n* Submit the requirements document to Canvas.\n\n* Once y
 ou have submitted\, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. 
 If they cannot open it from the computer they are using\, the graders will
  require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.\n\n* Te
 chnology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time
  to make a submission.\n\n--------------\nGrading Rubric\n\n--------------
 \n\nSteps 1a and 1b will be graded out of 10 points each (giving a combine
 d 20 points) on the following basis:\n\n*\n\n* Did you raise suitable requ
 ests for clarification and additional information in step 1a?\n\n* Does th
 e requirements set fully describe the system?\n\n* Are the relationships b
 etween the entities correctly identified?\n\n* Are the attributes of each 
 entity fully and correctly identified?\n\n* Does the requirements set inco
 rporate feedback received from peers and instructors?\n\n* Are at least th
 ree useful reports identified that could be produced from the proposed sys
 tem?\n\n19-20 points - Excellent work. Your team is ready to continue to t
 he next step.\n\n16-18 points - A good effort. Your mentor will indicate m
 inor changes that you should make before proceeding to the next step\n\nle
 ss than 15 points - Serious inadequacies. You need to contact your mentor

DESCRIPTION:----------\n Your Task\n----------\n\nCritically review & anal
 yze your presentation performance using the video recording. Utilize your 
 own thoughts and the silent feedback from your audience to set goals for c
 ontinuous improvement in the three areas of slide design\, speaker deliver
 y\, and audience engagement.\n\nPlease do not look at your silent feedback
  BEFORE you have watched your own presentation.\n\n-----\nSteps\n-----\n\n
 Step 1: Review Your Presentation Recording\, critique yourself\, and take 
 notes while watching your own talk. \n\nAccess the recording of your pres
 entation. Watch your presentation with a critical eye\, paying attention t
 o both verbal and non-verbal aspects. \n\nWhile watching your presentatio
 n\, take down notes observing three categories: that make a great presenta
 tion:\n\n*\n\n* Speaker: How was your speech\, your body language and ges
 tures? Did you move throughout the room or did you remain static\, did you
  look at the audience\, did you talk too fast or too slow?\n\n* Audience:
  Did you have an opener or closer and if so\, how did you feel about it? 
 Did you tell a story in between? Was the story good? Why? Could you have d
 one a better job? How? Did the audience engage with you and did you engage
  with them? \n\n* Slides: Was the content comprehensible\, did it make s
 ense\, could one understand it when engaging with it for the first time? W
 ere the slides readable\, could one see what you tried to show? Did the pr
 esentation look professional? Why? Why not?\n\nStep 2: Self-Assessment of 
 Your Presentation regarding your Strengths and Weaknesses \n\nUsing your 
 notes\, reflect on your own presentation performance\, identify and summar
 ize 2-3 strengths and 2-3 weaknesses you could observe.\n\nWrite down spec
 ific areas (e.g.\, Speaker: I am talking to fast\, I need to pace myself a
 nd take breaks.) and details you believe require improvement.\n\nStep 3: R
 eview the Audience Feedback of Your Presentation.\n\nOpen up the silent fe
 edback envelope you have received and read the notes.\n\nStep 4: Comparati
 ve Analysis of your self-assessment with the audience assessment \n\nComp
 are your self-assessment with the feedback received from your audience and
  note any similarities or discrepancies between your own assessment and th
 eir feedback. Consider the value of external perspectives in identifying a
 reas for improvement\, in contrast\, to your self-assessment. \n\nStep 5:
  3 Actionable Goals for Improvement\n\nBased on the feedback and self-asse
 ssment\, set 3 goals for improvement. These goals should be specific\, act
 ionable goals for improvement placed in each of the three categories (slid
 es\, speaker\, and audience).\n\nActionable means\, that you will describe
  what you would do/change to reach your goal. An Example Goal for the Slid
 es category could state that the goal is to have less text-dense slides an
 d better visuals which can be reached by utilizing bullet points and image
 s\n\nSlides: Minimize Text Density and Increase Visual Appeal\n\n* Limit 
 text on each slide to key points or concise statements.\n\n* Utilize bulle
 t points or visual cues to convey information effectively.\n\n \n\n------
 -----\n Submission\n-----------\n\nSubmission: Submit a PDF document con
 taining a narrative\, which covers:\n\n* Step 2: Your Self-Assessment of Y
 our Talk including 2-3 strengths and 2-3 weaknesses you have identified. 
 \n\n* Step 4: A comparative analysis of your self-assessment against the p
 eer assessment discussing similarities and discrepancies (e.g.\, did you l
 earn something from the peer feedback that you have not considered in your
  own review or vice-versa?)\;\n\n* Step 5: Use the comparative analysis to
  create 3 Actionable Goals for Improvement describing what you want to imp
 rove and how you plan to improve it. \n\nNote: This assignment aims to f
 oster self-reflection and targeted improvement. Utilize the feedback as a 
 valuable resource for honing your presentation skills. There is no minimum
  word count or expectation for this assignment. \n\n-------\nGrading\n---

DESCRIPTION:--------\nCategory\n\n--------\n\nThis assignment is in the Ana
 lyze/Model category\n\n--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nAs we start to get
  a feel for what information in the environment is useful to us\, it's imp
 ortant to record and organize that information in a way that makes sure we
  have all the important pieces and understand how it all relates and fits 
 together. This will enable us to have a solid foundation when we move forw
 ards with creating our databases. In this assignment you and your team wil
 l learn more about how a basic Entity-Relationship Diagram is created from
  system requirements.\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nYour task as a team is to
  create an ERD for WeFlyU Airport\, a local airport that maintains a fleet
  of small planes. The information below was given by the airport's manager
 .\n\n* Every airplane has a registration number\, crew size\, and year bui
 lt\, and each airplane is of a specific model.\n\n* The airport accommod
 ates a number of airplane models\, and each model is identified by a model
  number(e.g.\, DC-10) and has a capacity\, a weight\, dimensions (length\,
  wingspan\, height)\, max range\, and max speed.\n\n* A number of technici
 ans work at the airport. You need to store the name\, SSN\, address\, emai
 l\, and salary of each technician. Each technician is an expert on one or 
 more plane model(s)\, and his or her expertise may overlap with that of ot
 her technicians.  This information about technicians must also be recorde
 d.\n\n* Traffic controllers must have an annual medical examination. For e
 ach traffic controller\, you must store the date of the most recent exam.\
 n\n* All airport employees (including technicians) contribute to the compa
 ny pension plan.  You must store the retirement account number of each em
 ployee. You can assume that each employee is uniquely identified by his or
  her social security number.\n\n* The airport has a number of tests that
  are used periodically to ensure that airplanes are still airworthy. Each
  test has a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test number\, a nam
 e\, and a maximum possible score.\n\n* The FAA requires the airport to ke
 ep track of each time a given airplane is tested by a given technician usi
 ng a given test. For each testing event\, the information needed is the da
 te\, the number of hours the technician spent doing the test\, and the sco
 re that the airplane received on the test. \n\n--------------------\nSubm
 itting Your Work\n--------------------\n\nThis is a team assignment. Work 
 together with your team using the roles you are assigned for this module t
 o complete the task.\n\nRefer to this video for help with creating a digit
 al ERD using draw.io\, our preferred way for you to create ERDs in this co
 urse:\n\n \n\n* Your ERD document format must be a computer generated ima
 ge file\, like jpg or png or an image in a. No hand-drawn submissions will
  be accepted.\n\n* Submit the ERD document to Canvas.\n\n* Once you have s
 ubmitted\, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they c
 annot open it from the computer they are using\, the graders will not be a
 ble to give you feedback and you will not meet specifications.\n\n--------
 -------\n Specifications\n---------------\n\nFor a satisfactory evaluatio
 n\, complete at least 8 of the following specifications\n\nSpecification\n
 \nNotes\n\nSubmission is an ERD that follows the ERD conventions outlined 
 in class.\n\nConventions are things like entities are outlined with a rect
 angle that's solid for strong entities or dashed for weak\, relationships 
 are indicated with a diamond\, cardinalities are indicated along the line 
 connecting the entity to a relationship with two numbers\, etc. \n\nAll e
 ntities alluded to in the task information are represented in the ERD\n\nW
 hen taken together the entities in the ERD should be able to account for a
 ll the categories of things talked about in the ERD and those categories s
 hould be narrow enough to describe the thing in question without included 
 a lot of extraneous items. eg. an entity called "physical things" would no
 t be a good entity name as it's too broad.\n\nAll entities are correctly t
 yped as strong or weak\n\nAll relationships alluded to in the task informa
 tion are represented in the ERD\n\nEach relationship is connected to all o
 f the relevant entities and no entities that are not relevant.\n\nThis is 
 looking at each relationship to see if that relationship makes sense betwe
 en the participants and that there's no important aspect of the relationsh
 ip missing\n\nAll attributes alluded to in the task information are repres
 ented in the ERD attached to the correct entity\n\nAttributes have correct
  indications for primary\, composite\, and multivalued\n\nThese are the th
 ings indicated in our ERD with underlines\, parenthesis\, and asterisks in
  the attributes \n\nCardinalities are correctly indicated on all relation
 ships\n\nERD layout is clear and easy to read\n\n

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this team assignment you wi
 ll demonstrate how to create a conceptual schema (in this case an ERD) and
  then convert it into a logical schema (in this case\, a relational model)
 \n\nThis assignment aligns with the following I308 course learning outcome
 s:\n\n*\n\n* Analyze requirements and solicit information to design a Conc
 eptual Schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).\n\n* Convert an 
 ERD into a Logical Schema\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nMy Back Pages is a bo
 okstore that sells academic and scholarly books. The client is new to the 
 world of databases and is not very precise about specifying requirements.\
 n\nAs the consultants\, you will have to make reasonable assumptions about
  the business and explain your implementation choices. The client (i.e.\, 
 your instructors) will revise and expand on these decisions to provide you
  with an ERD and additional information for the individual assignment in t
 he second half of this module.\n\n* My Back Pages has several branches thr
 oughout Bloomington. Employees may be assigned to work at any of the branc
 hes at different times.\n\n* Employees are identified by an ID and have a 
 full name\, date of birth\, SSN\, address\, multiple phone numbers\, a gen
 der\, and a hire date.\n\n* A manager runs a branch and is responsible for
  all operations at that branch.\n\n* Cashiers sell books to customers. All
  purchases should have a date/time and receipt number recorded.\n\n* Books
  are identified by an ISBN number which identifies the title\, one or more
  authors\, a published date\, a publisher\, and an edition number. The Int
 ernational Standard Book Number (ISBN) is assigned to each edition of a bo
 ok.\n\n* Books are stocked on shelves by employee stockers. Each shelf has
  a location within a branch\, a capacity\, and an ID.\n\n* The manager ord
 ers books from suppliers. The system must capture the date and invoice num
 ber of all orders. Suppliers have an ID\, a name\, a contact person\, a we
 bsite\, an address\, and a phone number.\n\nAs a team\, you will need to f
 igure out what should or should not be included in the ERD and what additi
 onal information is needed and explain your reasoning for any decisions yo
 u make. These should appear as a series of notes in the ERD document. Part
  of your grade will depend on how reasonable these decisions are and how w
 ell you explain them in the notes.\n\nFinally\, you will convert your ERD 
 to a logical model and include the conversion as part of your submission.\
 n\nNote: This assignment contains information that may not apply to the da
 tabase such as workflow or job information. Your job is to figure out what
  is important for the data model of the organization.\n\n-----------------
 --------\nSubmitting the Assignment\n-------------------------\n\nThis is 
 a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and member names are 
 listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Your 
 mentor will verify with you during lab whether all members made equal cont
 ributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade 
 accordingly.\n\n* Your ERD document format must be .doc\, .docx\, .pdf\, o
 r .jpg. No hand-drawn submissions will be accepted.\n\n* Submit the ERD do
 cument to Canvas.\n\n* The ERD should include all entities\, attributes\, 
 relationships\, and cardinalities. You do need to include cardinality cons
 traints.\n\n* Once you have submitted\, check that your document opens cor
 rectly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are usin
 g\, the graders will not be able to grade it and you will receive a grade 
 of 0.\n\n* NOTE: The next assignment builds on this ERD\, and we provide a
  solution to this assignment as a starting point. Therefore\, absolutely n
 o late submissions will be allowed for this assignment.\n\n* Technology is
 sues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a 
 submission.\n\n--------------\nGrading Rubric\n\n--------------\n\nThe ERD
  will be graded on the following basis:\n\n* Are all entities correctly id
 entified and typed as strong or weak? (6 points)\n\n* Are the relationship
 s between the entities correctly identified? (6 points)\n\n* Are the attri
 butes of each entity correctly identified and categorized? (6 points)\n\n*
  Are all cardinality constraints correctly identified? (4 points)\n\n* Is 
 the ERD in a clear\, easy-to-read layout? (4 points)\n\n* Does the ERD con
 tain a Notes that explain any implementation decisions made? (4 points)\n\
 nThe logical model will be graded on the following basis:\n\n* Are all tab
 les properly identified? (7 points)\n\n* Are all attributes correctly iden
 tified in each table? (7 points)\n\n* Are all keys correctly indicated? (6
  points)\n\n

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this team assignment you wi
 ll demonstrate how to create a conceptual schema (in this case an ERD) and
  then convert it into a logical schema (in this case\, a relational model)
 \n\nThis assignment aligns with the following I308 course learning outcome
 s:\n\n*\n\n* Analyze requirements and solicit information to design a Conc
 eptual Schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).\n\n* Convert an 
 ERD into a Logical Schema\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nMy Back Pages is a bo
 okstore that sells academic and scholarly books. The client is new to the 
 world of databases and is not very precise about specifying requirements.\
 n\nAs the consultants\, you will have to make reasonable assumptions about
  the business and explain your implementation choices. The client (i.e.\, 
 your instructors) will revise and expand on these decisions to provide you
  with an ERD and additional information for the individual assignment in t
 he second half of this module.\n\n* My Back Pages has several branches thr
 oughout Bloomington. Employees may be assigned to work at any of the branc
 hes at different times.\n\n* Employees are identified by an ID and have a 
 full name\, date of birth\, SSN\, address\, multiple phone numbers\, a gen
 der\, and a hire date.\n\n* A manager runs a branch and is responsible for
  all operations at that branch.\n\n* Cashiers sell books to customers. All
  purchases should have a date/time and receipt number recorded.\n\n* Books
  are identified by an ISBN number which identifies the title\, one or more
  authors\, a published date\, a publisher\, and an edition number. The Int
 ernational Standard Book Number (ISBN) is assigned to each edition of a bo
 ok.\n\n* Books are stocked on shelves by employee stockers. Each shelf has
  a location within a branch\, a quantity\, and an ID.\n\n* The manager ord
 ers books from suppliers. The system must capture the date and invoice num
 ber of all orders. Suppliers have an ID\, a name\, a contact person\, a we
 bsite\, an address\, and a phone number.\n\nAs a team\, you will need to f
 igure out what should or should not be included in the ERD and what additi
 onal information is needed and explain your reasoning for any decisions yo
 u make. These should appear as a series of notes in the ERD document. Part
  of your grade will depend on how reasonable these decisions are and how w
 ell you explain them in the notes.\n\nFinally\, you will convert your ERD 
 to a logical model and include the conversion as part of your submission.\
 n\nNote: This assignment contains information that may not apply to the da
 tabase such as workflow or job information. Your job is to figure out what
  is important for the data model of the organization.\n\n-----------------
 --------\nSubmitting the Assignment\n-------------------------\n\nThis is 
 a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and member names are 
 listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Your 
 mentor will verify with you during lab whether all members made equal cont
 ributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade 
 accordingly.\n\n* Your ERD document format must be .doc\, .docx\, .pdf\, .
 jpg\, or .png. No hand-drawn submissions will be accepted.\n\n* Submit the
  ERD document to Canvas.\n\n* The ERD should include all entities\, attrib
 utes\, relationships\, and cardinalities. You do need to include cardinali
 ty constraints.\n\n* Once you have submitted\, check that your document op
 ens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they a
 re using\, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% o
 f your total score.\n\n* NOTE: The next assignment builds on this ERD\, an
 d we provide a solution to this assignment as a starting point. Therefore\
 , absolutely no late submissions will be allowed for this assignment.\n\n*
  Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra t
 ime to make a submission.\n\n--------------\nGrading Rubric\n\n-----------

DESCRIPTION:--------\nCategory\n\n--------\n\nThis assignment is in the Ana
 lyze/Model category\n\n--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this individual
  assignment\, you will build on the work you did in Assignment 2 to create
  a more complex conceptual schema (in this case an ERD).\n\n \n\n-----\nT
 ask \n-----\n\nIt is almost always the case that requirements are clarifi
 ed\, refined\, expanded\, and even changed during the design process\, oft
 en at the last minute. After presenting our original ERD to the client\, w
 e have found out more about the requirements for the WeFlyU Airport system
 .\n\nIn this assignment\, you will:\n\n* Modify the ERD your team created 
 for Assignment 1.2 and make the necessary changes to include the new requi
 rements\n\n* Complete the ERD by adding the attributes from the original r
 equirements along with all required cardinality constraints\n\nOriginal Re
 quirements (that should already be represented from 1.2)\n----------------
 ---------------------------------------------------\n\n* Every airplane ha
 s a registration number\, crew size\, and year built\, and each airplane i
 s of a specific model.\n\n* The airport accommodates a number of airplan
 e models\, and each model is identified by a model number(e.g.\, DC-10) an
 d has a capacity\, a weight\, dimensions (length\, wingspan\, height)\, ma
 x range\, and max speed.\n\n* A number of technicians work at the airport.
  You need to store the name\, SSN\, address\, and email salary of each tec
 hnician. Each technician is an expert on one or more plane model(s)\, and 
 his or her expertise may overlap with that of other technicians.  This in
 formation about technicians must also be recorded.\n\n* Traffic controller
 s must have an annual medical examination. For each traffic controller\, y
 ou must store the date of the most recent exam.\n\n* All company employees
  (including mechanics) contribute to the company pension plan.  You must 
 store the retirement account number of each employee. You can assume that 
 each employee is uniquely identified by his or her social security number.
 \n\n* The airport has a number of tests that are used periodically to en
 sure that airplanes are still airworthy. Each test has a Federal Aviat
 ion Administration (FAA) test number\, a name\, and a maximum possible s
 core.\n\n* The FAA requires the airport to keep track of each time a gi
 ven airplane is tested by a given technician using a given test. For eac
 h testing event\, the information needed is the date\, the number of hou
 rs the technician spent doing the test\, and the score that the airplane
  received on the test. \n\n \n\n----------------\nNew Requirements\n----
 ------------\n\n* Technicians perform repairs on airplanes as necessary an
 d record the date\, start/finish time\, problem\, part numbers used\, reso
 lution\, and cost.\n\n* The airport needs to store the date and score for 
 every medical exam given to controllers for historical purposes.\n\n* All 
 airplane flights in and out of the airport must be recorded. Each time a s
 pecific airplane lands or takes off\, the following information must be re
 corded: time\, date\, which controller authorized it\, runway number\, wha
 t plane it was\, and who was piloting the plane.\n\n* Pilot information mu
 st be recorded and consists of an ID number\, full name\, address\, licens
 e number\, phone number\, date of birth. Pilots are private citizens\, not
  employees of the airport. Each pilot is certified to fly one or more mode
 ls of airplanes.\n\n* Employees have multiple phone numbers.\n\n* For repa
 irs\,  part information is now stored in the system. Each part has a numb
 er\, manufacturer part number\, description\, image\, cost\, and what mode
 l of airplane it can be used on.\n\n*\n\n--------------------\nSubmitting 
 Your Work\n--------------------\n\nThis is an individual assignment. Work 
 independantly to complete the task.\n\nRefer to this video for help with c
 reating a digital ERD using draw.io\, our preferred way for you to create 
 ERDs in this course:\n\n \n\n* Your ERD document format must be a compute
 r generated image file\, like jpg or png or an image in a. No hand-drawn s
 ubmissions will be accepted.\n\n* Submit the ERD document to Canvas.\n\n* 
 Once you have submitted\, check that your document opens correctly from Ca
 nvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using\, the grader
 s will not be able to give you feedback and you will not meet specificatio
 ns.\n\n--------------\nSpecifications\n--------------\n\nFor a satisfactor
 y evaluation\, complete at least 8 of the following specifications\n\nSpec
 ification\n\nNotes\n\nSubmission is an ERD that follows the ERD convention
 s outlined in class.\n\nConventions are things like entities are outlined 
 with a rectangle that's solid for strong entities or dashed for weak\, rel
 ationships are indicated with a diamond\, cardinalities are indicated alon
 g the line connecting the entity to a relationship with two numbers\, etc.
  \n\nNo more than one entity alluded to in the task information is missin
 g from the ERD\n\nWhen taken together the entities in the ERD should be ab
 le to account for all the categories of things talked about in the ERD and
  those categories should be narrow enough to describe the thing in questio
 n without included a lot of extraneous items. eg. an entity called "physic
 al things" would not be a good entity name as it's too broad.\n\nAll entit
 ies are correctly typed as strong or weak\n\nNo more than one relationship
  alluded to in the task information is missing from the ERD\n\nEach relati
 onship is connected to all of the relevant entities and no entities that a
 re not relevant.\n\nThis is looking at each relationship to see if that re
 lationship makes sense between the participants and that there's no import
 ant aspect of the relationship missing\n\nNo more than one attribute allud
 ed to in the task information is missing from the ERD and all are attached
  to the correct entity\n\nAttributes have correct indications for primary\
 , composite\, and multivalued\n\nThese are the things indicated in our ERD
  with underlines\, parenthesis\, and asterisks in the attributes \n\nCard
 inalities are correctly indicated on all relationships\n\nERD layout is cl
 ear and easy to read\n\n

 ><strong>Purpose&nbsp\;</strong></h2>\n<p>In this individual assignment\, 
 you will build on the work you did in Assignment 2 to create a more comple
 x conceptual schema (in this case an ERD).</p>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<h2 style=
 "margin-top: 18px\; background-color: #fdeee8\; border-bottom: 5px inset #
 990000\;"><strong>Task&nbsp\;</strong></h2>\n<p>It is almost always the ca
 se that requirements are clarified\, refined\, expanded\, and even changed
  during the design process\, often at the last minute. After presenting ou
 r original ERD to the client\, we have found out more about the requiremen
 ts for the WeFlyU Airport system.</p>\n<p>In this assignment\, you will:</
 p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modify the ERD your team created for Assignment 1.2 and make
  the necessary changes to include the new requirements</li>\n<li>Complete 
 the ERD by adding the attributes from the original requirements along with
  all required cardinality constraints</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style="color:
  #7e8c8d\;">Original Requirements (that should already be represented from
  1.2)</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style="color: #7e8c8d\;">Every airplane
  has a registration number\, crew size\, and year built\, and each airplan
 e is&nbsp\;of a&nbsp\;specific model.</span></li>\n<li><span style="color:
  #7e8c8d\;">The airport accommodates a number of airplane models\, and eac
 h model is identified by a model number(e.g.\, DC-10) and has a capacity\,
  a weight\, dimensions (length\, wingspan\, height)\, max range\, and max 
 speed.</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: #7e8c8d\;">A number of technic
 ians work at the airport. You need to store the name\, SSN\, address\, and
  email salary of each technician. Each technician is an expert on one or m
 ore plane model(s)\, and his or her expertise may overlap with that of oth
 er technicians. &nbsp\;This information about technicians must also be rec
 orded.</span></li>\n<li><span style="color: #7e8c8d\;">Traffic controllers
  must have an annual medical examination. For each traffic controller\, yo
 u must store the date of the most recent exam.</span></li>\n<li><span styl
 e="color: #7e8c8d\;">All company employees (including mechanics) contribut
 e to the company pension plan. &nbsp\;You must store the retirement accoun
 t number of each employee. You can assume that each employee is uniquely i
 dentified by his or her social security number.</span></li>\n<li><span sty
 le="color: #7e8c8d\;">The airport&nbsp\;has a number&nbsp\;of tests that a
 re used periodically to ensure that airplanes are still airworthy. Each&nb
 sp\;test&nbsp\;has&nbsp\;a&nbsp\;Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) tes
 t number\, a&nbsp\;name\, and a&nbsp\;maximum possible score.</span></li>\
 n<li><span style="color: #7e8c8d\;">The FAA&nbsp\;requires the airport to&
 nbsp\;keep track of&nbsp\;each time a given airplane is tested by a&nbsp\;
 given technician using a given test. For&nbsp\;each testing event\, the in
 formation needed is&nbsp\;the date\, the number of&nbsp\;hours&nbsp\;the t
 echnician spent doing the test\, and the score&nbsp\;that the airplane rec
 eived on the test.&nbsp\;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<h2><span st
 yle="color: #269d53\;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt\;">New Require
 ments</span></strong></span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Technicians perform repairs o
 n airplanes as necessary and record the date\, start/finish time\, problem
 \, part numbers used\, resolution\, and cost.</li>\n<li>The airport needs 
 to store the date and score for every medical exam given to controllers fo
 r historical purposes.</li>\n<li>All airplane flights in and out of the ai
 rport must be recorded. Each time a specific airplane lands or takes off\,
  the following information must be recorded: time\, date\, which controlle
 r authorized it\, runway number\, what plane it was\, and who was piloting
  the plane.</li>\n<li>Pilot information must be recorded and consists of a
 n ID number\, full name\, address\, license number\, phone number\, date o
 f birth. Pilots are private citizens\, not employees of the airport. Each 
 pilot is certified to fly one or more models of airplanes.</li>\n<li>Emplo
 yees have multiple phone numbers.</li>\n<li>For repairs\,&nbsp\; part info
 rmation is now stored in the system. Each part has a number\, manufacturer
  part number\, description\, image\, cost\, and what model of airplane it 
 can be used on.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2 style="margin-top: 18px\; bac

 s an example of a fairly good set of data requirements based on a project 
 we are not doing this semester (a repair shop for phones\, tablets\, etc.)
 . It should give you an idea of the sort of thing we expect.\n\n \n\n----
 -\nTask \n-----\n\nYour task as a team is to create an ERD of your busine
 ss and a final set of data requirements for your final project. The data r
 equirements should be set out as a set of bullet points similar to those w
 e have been giving you for the ERD exercises. You should make it clear wha
 t the strong entities will be and the relationships between them. You must
  also include a separate list of 3 to 5 reports that could be generated fr
 om your proposed model that you think the client would find useful. Make s
 ure to discuss your ideas with your mentor and ensure their feedback is in
 cluded.\n\nThis is a team assignment. Please make sure your team number an
 d member names are listed. Only team member names that participated should
  be included. Your mentor will verify with you whether all members made eq
 ual contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team'
 s grade accordingly.\n\n--------------------\nSubmitting Your Work\n------
 --------------\n\nThis is a team assignment. Work together with your team 
 using the roles you are assigned for this module to complete the task.\n\n
 * Your ERD document format must be a computer generated image file from dr

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this individual assignment\
 , you will build on the work you did as a team in Assignment 2.1 to create
  a more complex conceptual schema (in this case an ERD).and then convert i
 t into a logical schema (in this case\, a relational model). You will also
  include notes that explain the choices you made in your design.\n\nThis a
 ssignment aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:\n\n*\n\
 n* Analyze requirements and solicit information to design a Conceptual Sch
 ema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).\n\n* Convert an ERD into a
  Logical Schema\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nAfter reviewing the ERD submitt
 ed in the team assignment\, the owner of  Bookery Nook has made some clar
 ifications about her previous requirements. Together\, these changes requi
 re an updated and expanded ERD and conversion. Your task is to modify the 
 ERD structure and the Conversion given below and make the necessary change
 s to include the new requirements.\n\nOriginal Requirements (Represented i
 n the ERD and Conversion below)\n-----------------------------------------
 --------------------------\n\n* My Back Pages has several branches through
 out Bloomington. Employees may be assigned to work at any of the branches 
 at different times.\n\n* Employees are identified by an ID and have a full
  name\, date of birth\, SSN\, address\, multiple phone numbers\, a gender\
 , and a hire date.\n\n* A manager runs a branch and is responsible for all
  operations at that branch.\n\n* Cashiers sell books to customers. All pur
 chases should have a date/time and receipt number recorded.\n\n* Books are
  identified by an ISBN number which identifies the title\, one or more aut
 hors\, a published date\, a publisher\, and an edition number. The Interna
 tional Standard Book Number (ISBN) is assigned to each edition of a book.\
 n\n* Books are stocked on shelves by employee stockers. Each shelf has a l
 ocation within a branch\, a capacity\, and an ID.\n\n* The manager orders 
 books from suppliers. The system must capture the date and invoice number 
 of all orders. Suppliers have an ID\, a name\, a contact person\, a websit
 e\, an address\, and a phone number.\n\nERD for Original Requirements\n---
 --------------------------\n\n[BookeryNook Part One-1-1.png] (https://iu.i
 nstructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821333/preview)\n\nThis file is a 
 [draw.io] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ITeqg2ps_ikP10HbEJGOiuhrf0qFvK
 Hv/view?usp=sharing) file containing this ERD. You do not have to build th
 e starting ERD yourself (unless you're using software other than draw.io).
 \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------\n\n* Click the link and choose to Download the file (S
 ave File).\n\n* Open draw.io and choose Open Existing Diagram.\n\n* Find t
 he file among your downloads and open it.\n\nNew Requirements and Clarific
 ations\n-----------------------------------\n\n* Employees are assigned ex
 actly one mentor who helps them with any issues they may face. An employee
  may mentor more than one employee.\n\n* My Back Pages has decided to impl
 ement an emergency response training program at the request of their insur
 ance company:\n\n* All staff are required to take a series of training cla
 sses on emergency procedures. Classes have an ID\, a title\, and a trainin
 g level.\n\n* Each class has one or more accompanying exams which must be 
 passed. Each exam has an ID\, a title\, a max score\, and a passing score.
  If the employee fails an exam\, they must take the class again.\n\n* The 
 system must keep track of each time employees take a class or exam.\n\n* M
 y Back Pages sells used books as well as new ones. Each copy of a book has
  a condition\, purchase price\, sale price\, date purchased\, and date sol
 d.\n\nYou will need to figure out what additional information is needed an
 d explain your reasoning for any decisions you make. These should appear a
 s a series of notes in the ERD document. Part of your grade will depend on
  how reasonable these decisions are and how well you explain them in the n
 otes. Be aware that creating an ERD is an art rather than an exact science
 . In more complex applications\, there are often several alternative ways 
 information could be represented. There is no single "correct" answer. You
 r goal is to come up with an ERD that contains the data in such a way that
  useful information could be retrieved. Sometimes\, you have information a
 bout the system that simply cannot be represented in an ERD but would have
  to be implemented later by a programmed business rule. Example: "Students
  must pay fees before they take the class." The point is that you need to 
 include sufficient information that someone who knows how to read an ERD c
 an understand your design and why you chose to design it that way. An obvi
 ous example is whether or not to use an ISA relationship: both choices may
  well be okay\, but you should explain why you chose to use one or not.\n\
 nFinally\, you will convert your ERD to a logical model and include the co
 nversion as part of your submission.\n\nSubmitting the Assignment\n-------
 ------------------\n\n* This is an individual assignment. You may not work
  with anyone else on this assignment. All work must be your own.\n\n* Your
  ERD document and Conversion document format must be .doc\, .docx\, .pdf\,
  or .jpg. No hand-drawn or hand-written submissions will be accepted.\n\n*
  The ERD should include all entities\, attributes\, relationships\, cardin
 ality constraints\, and notes explaining your decisions.\n\n* Submit the E
 RD document to Canvas. Also submit your notes/discussion and your Conversi
 on.\n\n* Once you have submitted\, check that your document opens correctl
 y from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using\, t
 he AIso will not be able to grade it and you will receive a grade of 0.\n\
 n* No late submissions will be accepted. Technology issues do not excuse a
  late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.\n\n-----
 -----------\nGrading Criteria\n\n----------------\n\nThe ERD (35 points) w
 ill be graded on the following basis:\n\n* Are all entities correctly iden
 tified and typed as strong or weak? (6 points)\n\n* Are the relationships 
 between the entities correctly identified? (6 points)\n\n* Are the attribu
 tes of each entity correctly identified and categorized? (6 points)\n\n* A
 re all cardinality constraints correctly identified? (4 points)\n\n* Is th
 e ERD in a clear\, easy-to-read layout? (3 points)\n\n* In this extension 
 of the assignment\, you included two new concepts - book copies\, and a me
 ntoring relationship. For each of these two new concepts\, address the fol
 lowing questions in your ERD notes:\n\n* What design alternatives did you 
 consider? (3 points)\n\n* Did you make reasonable decisions? (3 points)\n\
 n* Does your ERD accurately match the decisions you made? (4 points)\n\nTh
 e logical model (15 points) will be graded on the following basis:\n\n* Is
  your conversion an accurate representation of the ERD you submitted?\n\n*
  Are all tables properly identified? (5 points)\n\n* Are all attributes co
 rrectly identified in each table? (5 points)\n\n* Are all keys correctly i
 ndicated? (5 points)\n\n

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this team assignment your t
 eam  will demonstrate how to create a conceptual schema from requirements
 \, and then revise that schema after receiving feedback. This is a very co
 mmon professional activity in the technology world.\n\nThis assignment ali
 gns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:\n\n*\n\n* Analyze re
 quirements and solicit information to design a Conceptual Schema using an 
 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nYour task as
  a team is to create a final ERD for your final project.  Make sure to me
 et with your mentor to discuss your idea and ensure any of their feedback 
 is also included.\n\nThis is a team assignment.Please make sure your team 
 number and member names are listed. Only team member names that participat
 ed should be included. Your mentor will verify with you during lab whether
  all members made equal contributions to this assignment and may make adju
 stments to the team's grade accordingly.\n\n* Your ERD document format mus
 t be a PDF file.\n\n* Please do not upload as a PDF from Draw.io\, If you 
 do\, any difficulty in reading it may cause you to lose points. You can ex
 port draw.io diagrams as pdf files.\n\n* No hand-drawn submissions will be
  accepted.\n\n* The ERD should include all entities\, attributes\, relatio
 nships\, and cardinality constraints.\n\n* Submit the ERD document to Canv
 as. Once you have submitted\, check that your document opens correctly fro
 m Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are using\, the gr
 aders will not be able to grade it and you will receive a grade of 0.\n\n*
  No late submissions will be accepted. Technology issues do not excuse a l
 ate submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.\n\n-------
 -------\nGrading Rubric\n\n--------------\n\nThe ERD deliverable will be g
 raded out of 20 points on the following basis:\n\n* Are all entities corre
 ctly identified and typed as strong or weak?\n\n* Are the relationships be
 tween the entities correctly identified?\n\n* Are the attributes of each e
 ntity correctly identified and categorized?\n\n* Are all cardinality const
 raints correctly identified?\n\n* Did you include Notes or a Legend to exp
 lain any unclear points in your ERD or to capture any business rules that 
 cannot be implemented in the ERD?\n\n* Does the requirements set incorpora
 te feedback received from peers and instructors?\n\n19-20 points - Excelle
 nt work. Your team is ready to continue to the next step.\n\n16-18 points 
 - A good effort. Your mentor will indicate minor changes that you should m
 ake before proceeding to the next step\n\nless than 15 points - Serious in
 adequacies. You need to contact your mentor and arrange to resubmit this a
 ssignment with the necessary changes before proceeding to the next step. Y
 our grade on this assignment will be the average of your original grade an
 d the grade on your re-submission.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this individual assignment\
 , you will build on the work you did as a team in Assignment 2.1 to create
  a more complex conceptual schema (in this case an ERD).and then convert i
 t into a logical schema (in this case\, a relational model). You will also
  include notes that explain the choices you made in your design.\n\nThis a
 ssignment aligns with the following I308 course learning outcomes:\n\n*\n\
 n* Analyze requirements and solicit information to design a Conceptual Sch
 ema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).\n\n* Convert an ERD into a
  Logical Schema\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nAfter reviewing the ERD submitt
 ed in the team assignment\, the owner of  Bookery Nook has made some clar
 ifications about her previous requirements. Together\, these changes requi
 re an updated and expanded ERD and conversion. Your task is to modify the 
 ERD structure and the Conversion given below and make the necessary change
 s to include the new requirements.\n\nOriginal Requirements (Represented i
 n the ERD and Conversion below)\n-----------------------------------------
 --------------------------\n\n* My Back Pages has several branches through
 out Bloomington. Employees may be assigned to work at any of the branches 
 at different times.\n\n* Employees are identified by an ID and have a full
  name\, date of birth\, SSN\, address\, multiple phone numbers\, a gender\
 , and a hire date.\n\n* A manager runs a branch and is responsible for all
  operations at that branch.\n\n* Cashiers sell books to customers. All pur
 chases should have a date/time and receipt number recorded.\n\n* Books are
  identified by an ISBN number which identifies the title\, one or more aut
 hors\, a published date\, a publisher\, and an edition number. The Interna
 tional Standard Book Number (ISBN) is assigned to each edition of a book.\
 n\n* Books are stocked on shelves by employee stockers. Each shelf has a l
 ocation within a branch\, a quantity\, and an ID.\n\n* The manager orders 
 books from suppliers. The system must capture the date and invoice number 
 of all orders. Suppliers have an ID\, a name\, a contact person\, a websit
 e\, an address\, and a phone number.\n\nERD for Original Requirements\n---
 --------------------------\n\n[MyBackPages_Solution.jpg] (https://iu.instr
 ucture.com/courses/2204569/files/166383139/preview)\n\nThis [file] (https:
 //iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383115?wrap=1) is a draw.io 
 file containing this ERD. You do not have to build the starting ERD yourse
 lf (unless you're using software other than draw.io).\n\n-----------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Click the lin
 k and choose to Download the file (Save File).\n\n* Open draw.io and choos
 e Open Existing Diagram.\n\n* Find the file among your downloads and open 
 it.\n\nNew Requirements and Clarifications\n------------------------------
 -----\n\n* Employees are assigned exactly one mentor who helps them with a
 ny issues they may face. An employee may mentor more than one employee.\n\
 n* My Back Pages has decided to implement an emergency response training p
 rogram at the request of their insurance company:\n\n* All staff are requi
 red to take a series of training classes on emergency procedures. Classes 
 have an ID\, a title\, and a training level.\n\n* Each class has one or mo
 re accompanying exams which must be passed. Each exam has an ID\, a title\
 , a max score\, and a passing score. If the employee fails an exam\, they 
 must take the class again.\n\n* The system must keep track of each time em
 ployees take a class or exam.\n\n* My Back Pages sells used books as well 
 as new ones. Each copy of a book has a condition\, purchase price\, sale p
 rice\, date purchased\, and date sold.\n\nYou will need to figure out what
  additional information is needed and explain your reasoning for any decis
 ions you make. These should appear as a series of notes in the ERD documen
 t. Part of your grade will depend on how reasonable these decisions are an
 d how well you explain them in the notes. Be aware that creating an ERD is
  an art rather than an exact science. In more complex applications\, there
  are often several alternative ways information could be represented. Ther
 e is no single "correct" answer. Your goal is to come up with an ERD that 
 contains the data in such a way that useful information could be retrieved
 . Sometimes\, you have information about the system that simply cannot be 
 represented in an ERD but would have to be implemented later by a programm
 ed business rule. Example: "Students must pay fees before they take the cl
 ass." The point is that you need to include sufficient information that so
 meone who knows how to read an ERD can understand your design and why you 
 chose to design it that way. An obvious example is whether or not to use a
 n ISA relationship: both choices may well be okay\, but you should explain
  why you chose to use one or not.\n\nFinally\, you will convert your ERD t
 o a logical model and include the conversion as part of your submission.\n
 \nSubmitting the Assignment\n-------------------------\n\n* This is an ind
 ividual assignment. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment. 
 All work must be your own.\n\n* Your ERD document and Conversion document 
 format must be .doc\, .docx\, .pdf\, .jpg\, or .png. No hand-drawn or hand
 -written submissions will be accepted.\n\n* The ERD should include all ent
 ities\, attributes\, relationships\, cardinality constraints\, and notes e
 xplaining your decisions.\n\n* Submit the ERD document to Canvas. Also sub
 mit your notes/discussion and your Conversion.\n\n* Once you have submitte
 d\, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot o
 pen it from the computer they are using\, the graders will require you to 
 resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.\n\n* Technology issues 
 do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submi
 ssion.\n\n----------------\nGrading Criteria\n\n----------------\n\nThe ER
 D (35 points) will be graded on the following basis:\n\n* Are all entities
  correctly identified and typed as strong or weak? (6 points)\n\n* Are the
  relationships between the entities correctly identified? (6 points)\n\n* 
 Are the attributes of each entity correctly identified and categorized? (6
  points)\n\n* Are all cardinality constraints correctly identified? (4 poi
 nts)\n\n* Is the ERD in a clear\, easy-to-read layout? (3 points)\n\n* In 
 this extension of the assignment\, you included two new concepts - book co
 pies\, and a mentoring relationship. For each of these two new concepts\, 
 address the following questions in your ERD notes:\n\n* What design altern
 atives did you consider? (3 points)\n\n* Did you make reasonable decisions
 ? (3 points)\n\n* Does your ERD accurately match the decisions you made? (
 4 points)\n\nThe logical model (15 points) will be graded on the following
  basis:\n\n* Is your conversion an accurate representation of the ERD you 
 submitted?\n\n* Are all tables properly identified? (5 points)\n\n* Are al
 l attributes correctly identified in each table? (5 points)\n\n* Are all k
 eys correctly indicated? (5 points)\n\n

DESCRIPTION:--------\nCategory\n\n--------\n\nThis assignment is in the Dat
 abase Creation category\n\n--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nThe purpose of
  this discussion is for teams to submit their relational model and 5 possi
 ble data queries that could be run on the data model  instructors. This e
 xercise will help teams determine what SELECT queries they will be require
 d to create as part of their Final Project\n\n-----\n Task\n-----\n\nYour
  task as a team is to submit the following items for your final project:\n
 \n* Your final project relational model (conversion) with each table on a 
 separate line. Indicate foreign keys by underlining them and adding a ^ af
 ter the attribute.\n\n* Your current ERD so that the graders know the exac
 t ERD you are converting. If you find that you needed to make changes to y
 our ERD based on your ideas for queries\, you should include some text poi
 nting out the changes in the ERD compared to the one you submitted in Step
  2.\n\n* After consulting with your mentor\, submit a description of 5 pos
 sible queries that you might create. Each query must:\n\n* Involve data fr
 om multiple tables\n\n* Be reasonably used in the organization modeled. \
 n\n* Clearly indicate what data should be returned\n\n* Indicate the param
 eters that determine which instances of the data should be returned.\n\nEx
 ample:  "Find all of the full names and phone numbers of customers who at
 tended an event in a specified month."\n\nThe core work for this should ha
 ve been completed in project step 1. This is a chance to revise your initi
 al work to incorporate your mentor's feedback or other changes you would l
 ike to make and lock in your plan going forwards as well as start to think
  about the types of questions your database could be used to answer.\n\n 
 \n\nThis is a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and membe
 r names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be inc
 luded. Your mentor will verify with you during lab whether all members mad
 e equal contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the t
 eam's grade accordingly.\n\n* Submit a single .doc\, .docx\, or .pdf docum
 ent with all parts of the assignment. Once you have submitted\, check that
  your document opens correctly from Canvas.\n\n---------------\n Specific
 ations\n---------------\n\nFor a satisfactory evaluation\, complete all 3 
 asterisked specifications and at least 8 of the 11 other specifications\n\
 nSpecification\n\nNotes\n\nSubmission includes an ERD that follows the ERD
  conventions outlined in class.\n\nConventions are things like entities ar
 e outlined with a rectangle that's solid for strong entities or dashed for
  weak\, relationships are indicated with a diamond\, cardinalities are ind
 icated along the line connecting the entity to a relationship with two num
 bers\, etc. \n\nAll entities implied are represented in the ERD\n\nWhen t
 aken together the entities in the ERD should be able to account for all th
 e categories of things talked about in the ERD and those categories should
  be narrow enough to describe the thing in question without included a lot
  of extraneous items. eg. an entity called "physical things" would not be 
 a good entity name as it's too broad.\n\nAll relationships are identified 
 and represented in the ERD\n\nEach relationship is connected to all of the
  relevant entities and no entities that are not relevant.\n\nThis is looki
 ng at each relationship to see if that relationship makes sense between th
 e participants and that there's no important aspect of the relationship mi
 ssing\n\nEach entity has all relevant attributes represented in the ERD\, 
 attached to the correct entity\n\nAttributes have correct indications for 
 primary\, composite\, and multivalued\n\nThese are the things indicated in
  our ERD with underlines\, parenthesis\, and asterisks in the attributes 
 \n\nCardinalities are correctly indicated on all relationships\n\nRequirem
 ents conversion has the correct number of tables\n\nRequirements conversio
 n has suitable names for all tables\n\nRequirements conversion includes al
 l attributes from model\n\nRequirements conversion indicates primary and f
 oreign keys where appropriate\n\n*At least five distinct useful queries th
 at could be generated from the data are identified\n\n*Queries include mul
 tiple tables\n\n*Queries indicate which data should be returned\n\n

 Task</strong></h2>\n<p>Your task as a team is to submit the following item
 s for your final project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your final project relational mod
 el (conversion) with each table on a separate line. Indicate foreign keys 
 by underlining them and adding a ^ after the attribute.</li>\n<li>Your cur
 rent ERD so that the graders know the exact ERD you are converting. If you
  find that you needed to make changes to your ERD based on your ideas for 
 queries\, you should include some text pointing out the changes in the ERD
  compared to the one you submitted in Step 2.</li>\n<li>After consulting w
 ith your mentor\, submit a description of 5 possible queries that you migh
 t create. Each query must:\n<ul>\n<li>Involve data from multiple tables</l
 i>\n<li>Be reasonably used in the organization modeled.&nbsp\;</li>\n<li>C
 learly indicate what data should be returned</li>\n<li>Indicate the parame
 ters that determine which instances of the data should be returned.</li>\n
 </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style="color: #169179\;">Example:&nbsp\; "Fi
 nd all of the full names and phone numbers of customers who attended an ev
 ent in a specified month."</span></p>\n<p>The core work for this should ha
 ve been completed in project step 1. This is a chance to revise your initi
 al work to incorporate your mentor's feedback or other changes you would l
 ike to make and lock in your plan going forwards as well as start to think
  about the types of questions your database could be used to answer.</p>\n
 <p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>This is a team assignment. Please make sure your team n
 umber and member names are listed. Only team member names that participate
 d should be included. Your mentor will verify with you during lab whether 
 all members made equal contributions to this assignment and may make adjus
 tments to the team's grade accordingly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit a single .do
 c\, .docx\, or .pdf document with all parts of the assignment. Once you ha
 ve submitted\, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas.</li>\

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this individual assignment 
 you will use a SQL script to create tables in MySQL based on a given relat
 ional model and  populate those tables with appropriate data. You will th
 en add additional tables and write basic SELECT queries to retrieve inform
 ation from the database.\n\nThis activity aligns with the following I308 C
 ourse Outcomes:\n\n3. Implement the Logical Schema in a Relational Model (
 SQL)\n4. Populate a Relational Database with Data using SQL\n\n------\n T
 ask \n------\n\n[ctbp.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/fi
 les/166384245/preview)Your task is as follows:\n\nStep 1: Use the provided
  assignment31.sql script to create this simple database (5 points) :\n\n*\
 n\n* Download the [assignment31.sql] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2
 204569/files/166383124?wrap=1) file. (Note: We are naming the tables with 
 the "A_" prefix so that they will not conflict with the customer\, book\, 
 etc. that you will still need for in-class exercises.)\n\n* If you have no
 t done so already\, create a SQL directory in your Burrow home directory b
 y issuing the following command: mkdir sql\n\n* Use WinSCP or Cyberduck to
  upload the assignment31.sql file to your SQL directory on Burrow\n\n* Mak
 ing sure you are in your SQL directory on Burrow\, log in to your individu
 al MySQL account. (See [WATCH | Getting Started with MySQL] (https://iu.in
 structure.com/courses/2204569/pages/watch-%7C-getting-started-with-mysql-2
 ) for help.)\n\n* Run the assignment31.sql script by issuing the following
  command in MySQL: source assignment31.sql This will create the four table
 s pictured above and populate them with data. Note: the file must be in yo
 ur SQL directory\, and you must log into MySQL from that same directory fo
 r this to work!\n\n*\n\nStep 2: Modify the script by adding SQL code at th
 e end of your script to make the following changes to the database (5 poin
 ts each). Note: You can either edit the script locally and re-upload and r
 un it to make sure it runs correctly\, or you can edit it on the server. T
 he first approach is easier!\n\n* Create a table named A_bookcase that has
  the following attributes: bcid (primary key)\, location\, num_shelf\, cap
 acity\n\n* Create a table named A_book_bookcase with the following attribu
 tes: bookid (foreign key to id in A_book)\,  bcid (foreign key to bcid in
  A_bookcase)\, quantity\n\n* Add statements at the top of your script to d
 rop these two new tables so that the script can be run multiple times.\n\n
 * Insert the following data into A_bookcase and A_book_bookcase\n[bookcase
 .png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383175/preview)
 \n\n* Change Matt's address to 808 Bloom Street. Use an UPDATE statement. 
 Do not simply change the original INSERT statement.\n\n* Add the attribute
  “format” to the A_book table and update the data to indicate the form
 at of each book. Use an ALTER TABLE followed by an UPDATE statement. Do no
 t simply change the original INSERT statement. The Hacker Ethic and The Co
 de Book should be paperback and Web Programming should be hardback.\n\nSte
 p 3: Add the following SELECT queries to at the bottom of your script (5 p
 oints each):\n\n* Find the location of all bookcases with a capacity betwe
 en 40 and 45.\n\n* Find the title and bookcase ID of all books not stored 
 on bookcase 101.\n\n* Find the title\, price\, publisher\, and quantity of
  all paperback books.\n\n-------------------------\nSubmitting the Assignm
 ent\n-------------------------\n\n* This is an individual assignment. You 
 may not work with anyone else on this assignment. All work must be your ow
 n.\n\n* Submit your script as a single file titled assignment31.sql  on C
 anvas.\n\n* If you need help with creating and running a .sql script\, che
 ck out this video:\n\n*\n\n* Once you have submitted\, check that your doc
 ument opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the compute
 r they are using\, the graders will require you to resubmit for a maximum 
 of 50% of your total score.\n\n* Technology issues do not excuse a late su
 bmission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.\n\n-------------
 -\nGrading Rubric\n\n--------------\n\nThis assignment will be graded on t
 he following basis:\n\n* Point values for each portion of the assignment a
 re indicated above.\n\n* Does the script run in MySQL without errors?\n\n*
  Does each query accomplish what is asked without errors?

DESCRIPTION:--------\nCategory\n\n--------\n\nThis assignment is in the Dat
 abase Creation category\n\n--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this team-b
 ased assignment your team  will demonstrate how to use a SQL script to cr
 eate tables in MySQL based on a given relational model and  populate thos
 e tables with appropriate data. You will then add additional tables and wr
 ite basic SQL SELECT queries to retrieve information from the database.\n\
 n------\n Task \n------\n\nThis is a team based assignment. Your team ta
 sk is to:\n\nStep One: Develop a SQL script that creates all of the tables
  based on the following relational model:\nartist(id\, fname\, lname\, dob
 \, gender)\n\nband(id\,title\, year_formed)\n\nmember(artistID->\, bandID-
 >\, date_joined\, date_left\, instrument)\n\nalbum(id\, title\, year_publi
 shed\, bandID->)\n\nsong(id\, title\, length\, albumID->)\n\nNotes:\n\n* I
 f an artist is still in a band\, then the date_left column in the member t
 able would be NULL.\n\n* Be sure to set up primary and foreign keys correc
 tly and add the “engine=innodb” statement.\n\n* You may use [Example S
 QL Script] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/example-sql-s
 cript) as a guide to help you \n\nStep Two: For each of the 5 tables\, cr
 eate your own data to insert into each table according to the following re
 quirements:\n\n* There is a minimum of five rows of unique data per table 
 unless otherwise specified.\n\n* One band must have at least four artists\
 , and one of those artists left and rejoined the band after 12 years.\n\n*
  One artist must have been in three bands at different times\, and another
  artist must still be in two bands at once.\n\n* All bands must have at le
 ast two albums with three bands having more than two albums.\n\n* At leas
 t two female artists must have two or more albums in the same band.\n\n* E
 ach album must have 3-5 songs.\n\n* At least 4 songs must be more than 5 m
 inutes long.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Make sure to add your INSERT queries into the 
 SQL script.\n\n* Download and complete the [Assignment32Data.doc ] (https:
 //iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821384?wrap=1)file and submi
 t it with your assignment. This will assist the grader in validating that 
 your data meets the above requirement.\n\nStep Three: Add the following  
 SELECT queries at the bottom of the SQL script.\n\n* Query A: Choose a yea
 r. Return the titles of all albums released that year that year by any ban
 d. Make sure there is at least 1 album returned.\n\n* Query B: Return the 
 band name\, album title\, and song title for all songs more than five minu
 tes in length. Make sure there is at least 1 result returned.\n\n* Query C
 : Choose a band. Return the names of all songs that the band has released 
 along with the year the album containing the song was released.\n\n-------
 ------------------\nSubmitting the Assignment\n-------------------------\n
 \nThis is a team assignment.Please make sure your team number and member n
 ames are listed. Only team member names that participated should be includ
 ed. Your mentor will verify with you during lab whether all members made e
 qual contributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team
 's grade accordingly.\n\nSubmit a single assignment31.sql script and your 
 completed Assignment31Data.doc file on Canvas.\n\n---------------\n Speci
 fications\n---------------\n\nFor a satisfactory evaluation\, complete at 
 least 8 of the 11 specifications\n\nSpecification\n\nNotes\n\nSQL script i
 ncluded that creates all 5 of the tables indicated in task\n\nAll tables h
 ave the appropriate attributes\n\nNo more than 1 attribute is mistyped\n\n
 An attribute is mistyped when it has a type that is not the best fit for t
 he data indicated\, like if an attribute that deals with numbers was given
  the varchar type. The size of the attribute does not have to be exactly w
 hat we have in mind\, but should be broadly appropreate\, for example usin
 g int(1000000) for a number that we expect to have at most 3 digits would 
 be mistyped\n\nAppropriate data for Artist is added to table\n\nAppropriat
 e data for Band is added to table\n\nAppropriate data for Member is added 
 to table\n\nAppropriate data for Album is added to table\n\nAppropriate da
 ta for Song is added to table\n\nQuery A accomplishes what is asked withou
 t errors\n\nQuery B accomplishes what is asked without errors\n\nQuery C a
 ccomplishes what is asked without errors\n\n \n\n

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this individual assignment 
 you will use a SQL script to create tables in MySQL based on a given relat
 ional model and  populate those tables with appropriate data. You will th
 en add additional tables and write basic SELECT queries to retrieve inform
 ation from the database.\n\n------\n Task \n------\n\n[visualization of 
 4 tables. text found in assignment link] (https://iu.instructure.com/cours
 es/2204568/files/167820835/preview)Your task is as follows:\n\nStep 1: Use
  the provided [assignment32.sql] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/22045
 68/files/167821506?wrap=1) script to create this simple database:\n\n*\n\n
 * Download the assignment32.sql file. (Note: We are naming the tables with
  the "A_" prefix so that they will not conflict with the customer\, book\,
  etc. that you will still need for in-class exercises.)\n\n* If you have n
 ot done so already\, create a SQL directory in your Burrow home directory 
 by issuing the following command: mkdir sql\n\n* Use WinSCP or Cyberduck t
 o upload the assignment32.sql file to your SQL directory on Burrow\n\n* Ma
 king sure you are in your SQL directory on Burrow\, log in to your individ
 ual MySQL account. (See [WATCH | Getting Started with MySQL] (https://iu.i
 nstructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/watch-%7C-getting-started-with-mysql-
 2) for help.)\n\n* Run the assignment32.sql script by issuing the followin
 g command in MySQL: source assignment32.sql This will create the four tabl
 es pictured above and populate them with data. Note: the file must be in y
 our SQL directory\, and you must log into MySQL from that same directory f
 or this to work!\n\n*\n\nStep 2: Add a table to keep track of the various 
 bookshelves in our store and another table to keep track of which books ar
 e on which shelves.\n\nEach Bookcase has a location in the store\, a numbe
 r of shelves on the bookcase and how many books each shelf can hold. Our A
 _book_storage table keeps track of which books are on which bookcases usin
 g the id of the book\, id of the bookcase\, and the quantity of that parti
 cular book on that bookcase.\n\nModify the script from step 1 by adding SQ
 L code at the end of your script to make the following changes to the data
 base. Note: You can either edit the script locally and re-upload and run i
 t to make sure it runs correctly\, or you can edit it on the server. The f
 irst approach is easier!\n\n* Create a table named A_bookcase that has th
 e following attributes: bcid (primary key)\, location\, num_shelf\, shelf_
 capacity\n\n* Create a table named A_book_storage with the following attr
 ibutes: bookid (foreign key to bookid in A_book)\,  bcid (foreign key to 
 bcid in A_bookcase)\, quantity\n\n* Add statements at the top of your scri
 pt to drop these two new tables so that the script can be run multiple tim
 es.\n\n* Insert the following data into A_bookcase and A_book_storage\n[Va
 lues for book_storage and bookcase tables. Available from instructor upon 
 request.] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821507/prev
 iew)\n\n* Change Jenny's address to 1001 Mountain Drive. Use an UPDATE sta
 tement. Do not simply change the original INSERT statement.\n\n* Add the a
 ttribute “format” to the A_book table and update the data to indicate 
 the format of each book. Use an ALTER TABLE followed by an UPDATE statemen
 t. Do not simply change the original INSERT statement. The Hacker Ethic an
 d The Code Book should be paperback and Web Programming should be hardback
 .\n\n-------------------------\nSubmitting the Assignment\n---------------
 ----------\n\n* This is an individual assignment. You may not work with an
 yone else on this assignment. All work must be your own.\n\n* Submit your 
 script as a single file titled assignment32.sql  on Canvas.\n\n* Once you
  have submitted\, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas\n\n
 ---------------\n Specifications\n---------------\n\nFor a satisfactory e
 valuation\, complete at least 8 of the 10 specifications\n\nSpecification\
 n\nNotes\n\nSubmitted file named assignment32.sql\n\nSQL script included t
 hat creates both the tables indicated in task step 2\n\nAll tables have th
 e appropriate attributes\n\nNo more than 1 attribute is mistyped\n\nAn att
 ribute is mistyped when it has a type that is not the best fit for the dat
 a indicated\, like if an attribute that deals with numbers was given the v
 archar type. The size of the attribute does not have to be exactly what we
  have in mind\, but should be broadly appropreate\, for example using int(
 1000000) for a number that we expect to have at most 3 digits would be mis
 typed\n\nAppropriate data for A_bookcase is added to table\n\nAppropriate 
 data for A_book_storage is added to table\n\nassignment32.sql includes dro
 p statements for A_bookcase and A_book_storage at the appropriate place in
  file\n\nUPDATE statement that correctly changes Jenny's address\n\nFormat
  added to the A_book table using ALTER TABLE\n\nCorrect format added for e
 ach book\n\n(book format is either paperback or hardback)\n\n

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this team-based assignment 
 your team  will demonstrate how to use a SQL script to create tables in M
 ySQL based on a given relational model and  populate those tables with ap
 propriate data. You will then add additional tables and write basic SQL SE
 LECT queries to retrieve information from the database.\n\nThis activity a
 ligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:\n\n3. Implement the Logical
  Schema in a Relational Model (SQL)\n4. Populate a Relational Database wit
 h Data using SQL\n\n------\n Task \n------\n\nThis is a team based assig
 nment. Your team task is to:\n\nStep One: Develop a SQL script that create
 s all of the tables based on the following relational model (10 points):\n
 artist(id\, fname\, lname\, dob\, gender)\n\nband(id\,title\, year_formed)
 \n\nmember(artistID->\, bandID->\, date_joined\, date_left\, instrument)\n
 \nalbum(id\, title\, year_published\, bandID->)\n\nsong(id\, title\, lengt
 h\, albumID->)\n\nNotes:\n\n* The names of the tables and the columns in y
 our SQL script should be EXACTLY as is given in the above conversion.\n\n*
  If an artist is still in a band\, then the date_left column in the member
  table would be NULL.\n\n* Be sure to set up primary and foreign keys corr
 ectly and add the “engine=innodb” statement.\n\n* You may use [Example
  SQL Script] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/pages/example-sql
 -script) as a guide to help you \n\nStep Two: For each of the 5 tables\, 
 create your own data to insert into each table according to the following 
 requirements (5 points per table):\n\n* There is a minimum of five rows of
  unique data per table unless otherwise specified.\n\n* One band must have
  at least four artists\, and one of those artists left and rejoined the ba
 nd after 12 years.\n\n* One artist must have been in three bands at differ
 ent times\, and another artist must still be in two bands at once.\n\n* Al
 l bands must have at least two albums with three bands having more than tw
 o albums.\n\n* At least two female artists must have two or more albums i
 n the same band.\n\n* Each album must have 3-5 songs.\n\n* At least 4 song
 s must be more than 5 minutes long.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Make sure to add your I
 NSERT queries into the SQL script.\n\n* Download and complete the [Assignm
 ent32Data.doc] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383142
 ?wrap=1) file and submit it with your assignment. This will assist the gra
 der in validating that your data meets the above requirement.\n\nStep Thre
 e: Add the following  SELECT queries at the bottom of the SQL script. (5 
 points each)\n\n* Choose a year. Return the titles of all albums released 
 that year by any band. Make sure there is at least 1 album returned.\n\n* 
 Return the band name\, album title\, and song title for all songs more tha
 n five minutes in length. Make sure there is at least 1 result returned.\n
 \n* Choose a band. Return the names of all songs that the band has release
 d along with the year the album containing the song was released.\n\n-----
 --------------------\nSubmitting the Assignment\n-------------------------
 \n\nThis is a team assignment.Please make sure your team number and member
  names are listed. Only team member names that participated should be incl
 uded. Your mentor will verify with you whether all members made equal cont
 ributions to this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade 
 accordingly.\n\nSubmit a single assignment32.sql script and your completed
  Assignment32Data.doc file on Canvas.\n\n* Once you have submitted\, check
  that your documents open correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it fr
 om the computer they are using\, the graders will require you to resubmit 
 for a maximum of 50% of your total score.\n\n* NOTE: The next assignment b
 uilds on this one\, and we provide a solution to this assignment as a star
 ting point. Therefore absolutely no late submissions will be allowed for t
 his assignment.\n\n--------------\nGrading Rubric\n--------------\n\nThis 
 assignment will be graded on the following basis:\n\n* Point values for ea
 ch portion of the assignment are indicated above.\n\n* Does the SQL script
  run in MySQL without errors?\n\n* Does each query accomplish what is aske
 d without errors?\n\n

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nThe purpose of this discussion
  is for teams to submit their relational model and 5 possible data queries
  that could be run on the data model  instructors. This exercise will hel
 p teams determine what SELECT queries they will be required to create as p
 art of their Final Project\n\nThis activity aligns with the following I308
  Course Outcomes:\n\n3. Implement the Logical Schema in a Relational Model
  (SQL)\n\n4. Populate a Relational Database with Data using SQL\n\n5. Demo
 nstrate the ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a 
 SQL database and format the output data.\n\n-----\n Task\n-----\n\nYour t
 ask as a team is to submit the following items for your final project:\n\n
 * Your final project relational model with each table on a separate line. 
 Indicate foreign keys by underlining them and adding a ^ after the attribu
 te.\n\n* Your current ERD so that the graders know the exact ERD you are c
 onverting. If you find that you needed to make changes to your ERD based o
 n your ideas for queries\, you should include some text pointing out the c
 hanges in the ERD compared to the one you submitted in Step 2.\n\nAfter co
 nsulting with your mentor:\n\n* Include a brief description of what the fo
 cus of your system will be. Here is an example for a project on a meal del
 ivery service:\n\n“The focus of our system is to record information abou
 t delivery drivers and meals ordered for the company's Payroll Department.
  The system will keep track of orders placed by customers and which delive
 ry driver delivered the order. The system will also keep track of payments
  made by customers which can then be used to calculate the amount a driver
  made on an order.”\n\n* Submit a description of 5 possible queries that
  you might create. Each query must:\n\n*\n\n* Involve data from multiple t
 ables\n\n* Be reasonably used in the organization modeled. \n\n* Clearly 
 indicate what data should be returned\n\n* Indicate the parameters that de
 termine which instances of the data should be returned.\n\n* For example:
   "Find all of the full names and phone numbers of customers who attended
  an event in a specified month."\n\nThis is a team assignment. Please make
  sure your team number and member names are listed. Only team member names
  that participated should be included. Your mentor will verify with you du
 ring lab whether all members made equal contributions to this assignment a
 nd may make adjustments to the team's grade accordingly.\n\n* Submit a sin
 gle .doc\, .docx\, or .pdf document with all parts of the assignment. Once
  you have submitted\, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas
 . If they cannot open it from the computer they are using\, the graders wi
 ll require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.\n\n* 
 Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra ti
 me to make a submission.\n\n--------------\nGrading Rubric\n\n------------
 --\n\nThe logical data model will be graded on the following basis:\n\n* D
 oes the logical conversion correctly follow the ERD that was submitted?\n\
 n* Are all tables correctly identified?\n\n* Are the attributes for each t
 able correctly identified?\n\n* Are all primary and foreign keys correctly
  identified and indicated?\n\nThe data queries will be graded on the follo
 wing basis. The group clearly identifies 5 substantively unique data queri
 es that:\n\n* Can be run on the data model specified.\n\n* Require data fr
 om more than one table.\n\n* Clearly specify the data to be returned\n\n* 
 Clearly specify the parameters that determine which data is returned.\n\n1
 9-20 points - Excellent work. Your team is ready to continue to the next s
 tep.\n\n16-18 points - A good effort. Your mentor will indicate minor chan
 ges that you should make before proceeding to the next step\n\nless than 1
 5 points - Serious inadequacies. You need to contact your mentor and arran
 ge to resubmit this assignment with the necessary changes before proceedin
 g to the next step. Your grade on this assignment will be the average of y
 our original grade and the grade on your re-submission.

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nIn this individual assignment\
 , you will demonstrate how to use a SQL script to write more advanced SQL 
 SELECT queries to retrieve information from a band database.\n\nThis activ
 ity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:\n\n5. Demonstrate the
  ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL databas
 e and format the output data.\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nYour task is to c
 reate a single .sql script that contains the SQL queries that produce the 
 output for the following 5 questions.\n\n* Download this script: [assignme
 nt41.sql.] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821531?wra
 p=1)\n\n* After reading the queries that you need to write\, you may need 
 to edit the INSERT statements in the script as necessary to ensure you hav
 e adequate data.\n\n* Add the SELECT queries for this assignment to the en
 d of the script.\n\n* Run your copy of the script in your individual MySQL
  database.\n\nDo not hard code! In other words\, do not use specific IDs i
 n your WHERE instead of writing a query that works for any data added that
  might be added to the tables. Don't just look at the data\, figure out th
 e answer and then print that specific name or ID\n\nWhenever you're asked 
 for an artist's full name\, combine the parts of their name into one value
   - i.e. if fname = "Jane" and lname = "Doe"\, return "Jane Doe".\n\nQues
 tion 1\n----------\n\nFor each artist who is currently in a band and is un
 der 30 years old: *\n\nReturn the artist’s full name\, gender\, date of 
 birth (formatted like  "06/12/2019")\, and the name of the band they are 
 in with date joined formatted like "July 18\, 2022".\n\nOrder the results 
 by artist name\n\n* You will not get full points if you just say something
  like DOB > '1992-03-23' (hard coded thirty tears ago today). The query wo
 uld not age well!\n\nQuestion 2\n----------\n\nFor all artists who are cur
 rently in a band:\n\nReturn the artist’s full name (as a single value)\,
  the band name\, and how long in years the artist has been in the band. Th
 e artist should only be shown once for each band.\n\n(Hint: Remember that 
 the data might include an artist who left a band and then rejoined. That i
 s the challenge here!)\n\nQuestion 3\n----------\n\nFor each band that cur
 rently has a female member:\n\nReturn the name of the band and each female
  artist's full name (as a single value).\n\nOrder by band name and artist 
 name.\n\nAs a bonus\, you can try fining the information for all current m
 embers of bands that currently have a female member instead of just the fe
 male members themselves\n\nQuestion 4\n----------\n\nFind the album title\
 , band name\, format\, and total length of all albums released since Janua
 ry 1\, 2000.\n\nOrder from longest to shortest.\n\nReturn the format as th
 e word "single" or "double" rather than just the stored value "s" or "d". 
 (Google 'mySQL IF() function'.)\n\nAs a bonus\, you can try to get the tot
 al length to look like a reasonable time value rather than just a big numb
 er. This is hard! Google "summing time values in MySQL".\n\n--------------
 -----------\nSubmitting the Assignment\n-------------------------\n\nThis 
 is an individual assignment. Submit a single assignment41.sql script on Ca
 nvas. This should include all the DROP TABLE\, CREATE\, INSERT\, and SELEC
 T statements so that the grader can run it in their own database.\n\n-----
 ----------\n Specifications\n---------------\n\nFor a satisfactory evalua
 tion\, complete at least 16 of the 21 specifications\n\nSpecification\n\nN
 otes\n\nSQL script included that has DROP\, CREATE\, INSERT\, and SELECT s
 tatements\n\nQuery for Question 1 runs without errors\n\nFor this specific
 ation you simply need to have something labeled with a comment indicating 
 it's for Q1 that does not produce an error when run\n\nQuery for Question 
 1 includes all of the indicated attributes\n\nQuery for Question 1 formats
  the dates as indicated\n\nQuery for Question 1 finds all relevant results
 \n\nQuery for Question 1 orders results by artist name\n\nQuery for Questi
 on 2 runs without errors\n\nFor this specification you simply need to have

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nYou have been hired to manage 
 the database for the Fish 'n' Pickles Restaurant. The manager\, Durant Pum
 frey\, hopes to use your expertise to complete a deep dive on the company'
 s historical records before pressing ahead with new data (Questions 1 and 
 2). Durant is also curious about what happens when no manager is on duty t
 o supervise (Questions 3 and 4). Database professionals frequently have to
  come up with such "ad hoc" queries to answer questions as they arise\n\nT
 his is a team assignment\, but you will be working in the large dataset ac
 count (i308_data) with the big database.\n\nIn the Task section we will sh
 ow the questions you are asked to solve and also will show the results fro
 m the system that you should get.\n\nThis module aligns with the following
  I308 course learning outcomes:\n\n5. Demonstrate the ability to write ad
 vanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the out
 put data.\n\n------\n Task \n------\n\nYour individual task is to create
  a single .sql script that contains just the SQL SELECT queries that produ
 ce the output for the following 5 questions.\n\nQuestion 1\n----------\n\n
 "We are trying to reduce menu items\, so we are looking for poor sales. Pl
 ease show me the item name\, item price\, and number sold in year 2013\, b
 ut limit it to only ten items and list them in order of least number sold.
 "\n\nYour results should match this exactly:\n\n[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at

 49/preview)\n\n Question 2\n\n“Hmm... We probably should look at the to
 tal sales price. Please add (to the first query) the total sales for the i
 tems and order by the lowest 10 total sales. Let's see totals for 2013 and
  2014."\n\nHint: This query can be written by making additions and/or mino
 r changes to Question 1.\n\nYour results should match this exactly:\n\n[Sc

 s/2204568/files/167821061/preview)\n\n \n\nQuestion 3\n----------\n\nWe'r
 e going to build up to the times where there was no manager working. To st
 art with\, lets find all the unique shift and date combinations where ther
 e WAS a manager on duty.\n\nYour results should match this with 75 more ro
 ws after these 10:\n\n[A424.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/22045

 re for space)\n\nImportant Note: There are two different ways to write thi
 s that give different results. It turns out that the data is actually not 
 consistent! Use the date in the emp_shift table rather than the day_of_wee
 k value in the shift table.\n\n \n\nQuestion 4\n----------\n\n“Now let'
 s look at staffing when no manager was on duty. For each day of the week d
 uring 2003\, 2004\, and 2005\, how many staff (total) were working when no
  one was working in the manager role?"\n\nHint: You will need to use a sub
 query. The subquery will find the days when a manager was working\, and th
 e main query will return data about the days not returned by the subquery.

 he one you created in team assignment 3.2.\n\nThis activity aligns with th
 e following I308 Course Outcomes:\n\n5. Demonstrate the ability to write 
 advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the o
 utput data.\n\n-----\nTask \n-----\n\nYour task is to create a single .sq
 l script that contains the SQL queries that produce the output for the fol
 lowing 5 questions.\n\n* Download this script: [assignment41.sql.] (https:
 //iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383819?wrap=1)\n\n* IMPORTAN
 T NOTE: This script will create a new set of tables and a new dataset comp
 ared to your submission for the previous assignment. Don't worry: we will 
 still be able to grade Assignment 3.2 by running the script that you turne
 d in. However\, if for any reason you have not submitted assignment 3.2\, 
 consult with your instructor.\n\n* After reading the queries that you need
  to write\, you may need to edit the INSERT statements in the script as ne
 cessary to ensure you have adequate data.\n\n* Add the SELECT queries for 
 this assignment to the end of the script.\n\n* Run your copy of the script
  in your individual MySQL database.\n\nDo not hard code! In other words\, 
 do not use specific IDs in your WHERE instead of writing a query that work
 s for any data added that might be added to the tables. Don't just look at
  the data\, figure out the answer and then print that specific name or ID\
 n\nWhenever you're asked for an artist's full name\, combine the parts of 
 their name into one value  - i.e. if fname = "Jane" and lname = "Doe"\, r
 eturn "Jane Doe".\n\nQuestion 1\n----------\n\nFor each artist who is curr
 ently in a band and is under 30 years old: *\n\nReturn the artist’s full
  name\, gender\, date of birth (formatted like  "06/12/2019")\, and the n
 ame of the band they are in with date joined formatted like "July 18\, 202
 2".\n\nOrder the results by artist name\n\n* You will not get full points 
 if you just say something like DOB > '1992-03-23' (hard coded thirty years
  ago today). The query would not age well!\n\nQuestion 2\n----------\n\nFo
 r all artists who are currently in a band:\n\nReturn the artist’s full n
 ame (as a single value)\, the band name\, and how long in years the artist
  has been in the band. The artist should only be shown once for each band.
 \n\n(Hint: Remember that the data might include an artist who left a band 
 and then rejoined. That is the challenge here!)\n\nQuestion 3\n----------\
 n\nFor each band that currently has a female member:\n\nReturn the name of
  the band and each artist's full name (as a single value).\n\nOrder by ban
 d name and artist name.\n\nComment: It is fairly easy to write a query tha
 t returns just the female members who are currently in bands (12 rows)\; d
 oing this correctly will earn you the 7 points for this question. However\
 , the question is really asking for all current members of bands that curr
 ently have a female member (20 rows)\; I don't believe that can be done wi
 thout a subquery\, so if you do some research and figure out how to do the
  subquery\, you can earn 2 bonus points.\n\nQuestion 4\n----------\n\nFind
  the album title\, band name\, format\, and total length of all albums rel
 eased since January 1\, 2000.\n\nOrder from longest to shortest.\n\nTry to
  return the format as the word "single" or "double" rather than just the s
 tored value "s" or "d". (Google 'mySQL IF() function'.)\n\nTry to get the 
 total length to look like a reasonable time value rather than just a big n
 umber. This is hard! Google "summing time values in MySQL".\n\nQuestion 5\
 n----------\n\nFor all bands:\n\nReturn how many artists are currently in 
 the band\, how many artists have ever been in the band (be careful not to 
 count the same artists multiple times if they've left and rejoined) and th
 e number of albums the band has made. This is tricky! There are a number o
 f ways you can approach this.\n\nOrder by band from A-Z.\n\n--------------
 -----------\nSubmitting the Assignment\n-------------------------\n\nThis 
 is an individual assignment. Submit a single assignment41.sql script on Ca
 nvas. This should include all the DROP TABLE\, CREATE\, INSERT\, and SELEC
 T statements so that the graders can run it in their own database.\n\nOnce
  you have submitted\, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas
 . If they cannot open it from the computer they are using\, the graders wi
 ll require you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score.\n\nLa
 te submissions will be accepted subject to the standard course policy. Tec
 hnology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time 
 to make a submission.\n\n--------------\nGrading Rubric\n\n--------------\
 n\nThis assignment will be graded on the following basis:\n\n* The assignm
 ent is turned in as a single .sql script that runs without errors. (15 poi
 nts)\n\n* Each question is worth 7 points. If the query runs in MYSQL with
 out errors\, you will get 3 points. If the query accomplishes what is aske
 d\, you will get the additional 4 points for that query.

DESCRIPTION:--------\nCategory\n\n--------\n\nThis assignment is in the Dat
 abase Creation category\n\n---------\n Purpose \n---------\n\nThe purpos
 e of this project step is for teams to create their Final Project database
  based on the relational model turned in for Project Step 3 and populate i
 t with sufficient data to demonstrate that their queries work correctly.\n
 \nThis activity aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:\n\n4. Popu
 late a Relational Database with Data using SQL\n\n5. Demonstrate the abili
 ty to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and 
 format the output data.\n\n------\n Task \n------\n\nYour team task is t
 o develop a single .sql script that:\n\n* Creates all of the tables in you
 r logical model\n\n* Populates each table with enough data to show that th
 e queries you turned in for Project Step 3 actually work as intended.\n\nD
 ata requirements:\n\n* You need to create sufficient data to demonstrate t
 hat your design works and that your queries return the appropriate data.\n
 \n* A general rule of thumb is at least 10 rows per table based on strong 
 entities (the "base" tables)\, but consult with your mentor to make sure y
 our data is sufficient. In particular\, make sure that you are inserting l
 ots of data for the transaction table(s) in your system.\n\n* Do not simpl
 y insert multiple identical rows—for example\, the same student living i
 n the same room multiple times.  The data should be believable.\n\n* Incl
 ude any other data that is necessary for your system to function. Remember
  you are creating it to sell the system to a client so it should look as r
 ealistic as possible.\n\nYou may use [Mockaroo] (https://www.mockaroo.com/
 ) or a similar data generation service to help create your data.\n\nSee th
 e video below for a tutorial on how to use Mockaroo:\n\n------------------
 --------\n Submitting the Assignment\n--------------------------\n\nThis 
 is a team assignment. Please make sure your team number and member names a
 re listed. Only team member names that participated should be included. Pe
 rcentages for participation can be used for members. \n\nSubmit a single 
 .sql script file with both parts of the assignment. Once you have submitte
 d\, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas.\n\n-------------
 --\n Specifications\n---------------\n\nFor a satisfactory evaluation\, c
 omplete at least 7 of the 8 specifications\n\nSpecification\n\nNotes\n\nSu
 bmitted file as a single .sql file\n\nSQL script included that creates a t
 able for each table in ERD\n\nNo more than 1 table is missing an attribute
  from the ERD\n\nNo more than 1 attribute is mistyped\n\nAn attribute is m
 istyped when it has a type that is not the best fit for the data indicated
 \, like if an attribute that deals with numbers was given the varchar type
 . The size of the attribute does not have to be exactly what we have in mi
 nd\, but should be broadly appropreate\, for example using int(1000000) fo
 r a number that we expect to have at most 3 digits would be mistyped\n\nAp
 propriate data is generated for each table\n\nAt least 10 rows of data is 
 generated for each table\n\nData is varied and believable\n\nValues should
  be different ex. not just repeating the same name or entering random lett
 ers for values.\n\nSQL runs without errors\n\n

DESCRIPTION:---------\n Purpose \n---------\n\nThe purpose of this discus
 sion is for teams to establish a definitive list of SQL queries to be writ
 ten for their Final Project based on the those that were identified in [PR
 OJECT | Step 2: Logical Schema & SELECT Query Ideas] (https://iu.instructu
 re.com/courses/2204568/assignments/15854217) as updated after discussions 
 with their mentor and/or instructor.\n\nThis activity aligns with the foll
 owing I308 Course Outcomes:\n\n5. Demonstrate the ability to write advance
 d SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output d
 ata.\n\n------\n Task \n------\n\nYour team task is to write detailed sp
 ecs for your five SELECT queries. Note that your final list of queries may
  require you go back and make changes to your database design and build st
 eps.\n\nRequirements:\n\n      Your team should have five queries in to
 tal:\n\n* All queries must require JOINs\n\n* At least 1 query must utiliz
 e a nested query\n\n* At least 3 queries must utilize aggregation (SUM\, C
 OUNT\, etc.) in some form.\n\n* In combination\, queries must exercise all
  the parts of your database. Don't write queries that are very similar to 
 each other.\n\n* Make sure there is  sufficient data in each table of you
 r database to demonstrate that your queries return the appropriate data.\n
 \n* Please use the following format as an example:\n\nNAME OF QUERY: Most 
 Popular Meals\n\nSHOW name-of-meal and number of times ordered for 10 most
  frequently ordered meals\n\nFOR [user-chosen dorm]\n\nQUERY WILL USE: JOI
 N yes SUBQUERY no AGGREGATION yes\n\n--------------------------\n Submitt
 ing the Assignment\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a Team assignmen
 t that is part of the Final Project assignment group. Please make sure you
 r team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that par
 ticipated should be included. Percentages for participation can be used fo
 r members. \n\nSubmit a single \,txt or .doc file all queries for the ass
 ignment. Once you have submitted\, check that your document opens correctl
 y from Canvas\n\n---------------\n Specifications\n---------------\n\nFor
  a satisfactory evaluation\, complete at least 7 of the 8 specifications\n
 \nSpecification\n\nNotes\n\nAt least 5 query ideas submitted\n\nQuery idea
 s are formatted in the format of the example\n\nex: \n\nNAME OF QUERY: Mo
 st Popular Meals\n\nSHOW name-of-meal and number of times ordered for 10 m
 ost frequently ordered meals\n\nFOR [user-chosen dorm]\n\nQUERY WILL USE: 
 JOIN yes SUBQUERY no AGGREGATION yes\n\nAt least 5 query ideas combine inf
 ormation from more than 1 table\n\nAt least 1 query idea requires a nested
  query\n\nAt least 3 query ideas use an aggregate function\n\nNo more than
  1 table from the database is not used in any queries \n\nEach query is s
 upported by sufficient data in the database to return at least 3 results\n
 \nQueries reflect the suggestions and input of Mentor from previous steps

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nYou have been hired to manage 
 the database for the Fish 'n' Pickles Restaurant. The manager\, Durant Pum
 frey\, hopes to use your expertise to get some information that will help 
 him plan next year’s menu (Questions 1\, 2\, and 3). Durant is also conc
 erned about rumors of employees misbehaving when no manager is on duty to 
 supervise them (Questions 4 and 5). Database professionals frequently have
  to come up with such "ad hoc" queries to answer questions as they arise\n
 \nThis is a team assignment\, but you will be working in the large dataset
  account (i308_dataset) with the big database.\n\nIn the Task section we w
 ill show the questions you are asked to solve and also will show the resul
 ts from the system that you should get.  For full credit\, please confirm
  your results are exactly the same as what is shown.\n\nThis module aligns
  with the following I308 course learning outcomes:\n\n5. Demonstrate the 
 ability to write advanced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database
  and format the output data.\n\n------\n Task \n------\n\nYour team task
  is to create a single .sql script that contains just the SQL SELECT queri
 es that produce the output for the following 5 questions.\n\nQuestion 1\n-
 ---------\n\n"We are trying to reduce menu items\, so we are looking for p
 oor sales. Please show me the item name\, item price\, and number sold in 
 year 2013\, but limit it to only ten items and list them in order of least
  number sold."\n\nYour results should match this exactly:\n\n[Screenshot 2
 023-03-27 at 11.52.23 AM.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/
 files/166383854/preview)\n\n Question 2\n\n“Hmm... We probably should l
 ook at the total sales price. Please add (to the first query) the total sa
 les for the items and order by the lowest 10 total sales. Let's see totals
  for 2013 and 2014."\n\nHint: This query can be written by making addition
 s and/or minor changes to Question 1.\n\nYour results should match this ex
 actly:\n\n[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 11.55.40 AM.png] (https://iu.instructu
 re.com/courses/2204569/files/166383859/preview)\n\nQuestion 3\n----------\
 n\n"I want compare the years 2011 and 2012 month by month to see what time
  of year is most profitable.”\n\nHint: This query requires some Googling
  to get the formats and sorting order exactly right.\n\nYour results shoul
 d match this exactly:\n\n[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 12.03.54 PM.png] (https
 ://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/166383866/preview)\n\nQuestion
  4\n----------\n\n“Now let's look at staffing. For each day of the week 
 during 2003\, 2004\, and 2005\, how many staff (total) were working when n
 o one was working in the manager role?"\n\nHint: You will need to use a su
 bquery. The subquery will find the days when a manager was working\, and t
 he main query will return data about the days not returned by the subquery
 .\n\nYour results should match this exactly:\n\n[Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 
 12.04.41 PM.png] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204569/files/1663838
 85/preview)\n\nImportant Note: There are two different ways to write this 
 that give different results. It turns out that the data is actually not co
 nsistent! Use the date in the emp_shift table rather than the day_of_week 
 value in the shift table.\n\nQuestion 5\n----------\n\n“Based upon quest
 ion 4\, show the full names\, role\, and date of any employees working on 
 a day when no manager was on duty but at least 2 people were working in th
 e years 2010 and 2011.”\n\nHint: This final query is challenging. It inv
 olves an extra level of subquery. You can adapt the answer to Question 4 a
 s the top-level subquery.\n\nYour results should match this exactly:\n\n[S

 bmitting the Assignment\n-------------------------\n\nThis is a team assig
 nment. Please make sure your team number and member names are listed. Only
  team member names that participated should be included. Your mentor will 
 verify with you during lab whether all members made equal contributions to
  this assignment and may make adjustments to the team's grade accordingly.
 \n\nSubmit a single assignment42.sql script file on Canvas.\n\nOnce you ha
 ve submitted\, check that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If th
 ey cannot open it from the computer they are using\, the graders will requ
 ire you to resubmit for a maximum of 50% of your total score. Technology i
 ssues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a
  submission.\n\n---------------\n Grading Rubric\n\n---------------\n\nTh
 is assignment will be graded on the following basis:\n\n* The queries in a
  single .sql file\, you have attempted all the queries\, and the script ru
 ns error-free. (10 points)\n\n* The output of each query submitted matches
  exactly the result given. Each query is worth 8 points. Partial credit is
  possible if the output is close.\n\n

 aligns with the following I308 Course Outcomes:\n\n4. Populate a Relationa
 l Database with Data using SQL\n\n5. Demonstrate the ability to write adva
 nced SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the outpu
 t data.\n\n------\n Task \n------\n\nYour team task is to develop a sing
 le .sql script that:\n\n* Creates all of the tables in your logical model 
 (CREATE TABLE statements)\n\n* Populates each table with enough data to sh
 ow that the queries you turned in for Project Step 3 actually work as inte
 nded. (INSERT statements)\n\nData requirements:\n\n* You need to create su
 fficient data to demonstrate that your design works and that your queries 
 return the appropriate data.\n\n* A general rule of thumb is at least 10 r
 ows per table based on strong entities (the "base" tables)\, but consult w
 ith your mentor to make sure your data is sufficient. In particular\, make
  sure that you are inserting lots of data for the transaction table(s) in 
 your system.\n\n* Do not simply insert multiple identical rows—for examp
 le\, the same student living in the same room multiple times. This will re
 sult in a zero grade for this part of the project. The data should be beli
 evable.\n\n* Include any other data that is necessary for your system to f
 unction. Remember you are creating it to sell the system to a client so it
  should look as realistic as possible.\n\nYou may use [Mockaroo] (https://
 www.mockaroo.com/) or a similar data generation service to help create you
 r data.\n\nSee the video below for a tutorial on how to use Mockaroo:\n\n-
 -------------------------\n Submitting the Assignment\n------------------
 --------\n\nThis is a team assignment that is part of the Final Project as
 signment group. Please make sure your team number and member names are lis
 ted. Only team member names that participated should be included. Percenta
 ges for participation can be used for members. \n\nSubmit a single .sql s
 cript file with both parts of the assignment. Once you have submitted\, ch
 eck that your document opens correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it
  from the computer they are using\, the graders will require you to resubm
 it for a maximum of 50% of your total score.\n\nTechnology issues do not e
 xcuse a late submission. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.\n
 \n---------------\n Grading Rubric\n\n---------------\n\nThe script will 
 be graded on the following basis:\n\n* Are all tables correctly created ba
 sed on the ERD and logical model submitted in Project Step 3?\n\n* Are all
  primary and foreign keys correctly identified with constraints?\n\n* Are 
 the datatypes used for each attribute appropriate?\n\n* Is there sufficien
 t data populating the tables to run the queries?\n\n* Does the data meet t
 he requirements outlined above for the  assignment?\n\n19-20 points - Exc
 ellent work. Your team is ready to continue to the next step.\n\n16-18 poi
 nts - A good effort. Your mentor will indicate minor changes that you shou
 ld make before proceeding to the next step\n\nless than 15 points - Seriou
 s inadequacies. You need to contact your mentor and arrange to resubmit th
 is assignment with the necessary changes before proceeding to the next ste
 p. Your grade on this assignment will be the average of your original grad
 e and the grade on your re-submission.

DESCRIPTION:--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nThe purpose of this assignment
  is to practice creating web-based front ends in PHP to safely expose data
  from our bands database.\n\nThis activity aligns with the following I308 
 course learning outcomes:\n\n5. Demonstrate the ability to write advanced
  SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output da
 ta.\n\n6. Create a Web-Based Portal For Interacting With Data\n\n------\n
  Task \n------\n\nPart One\n\nStep 1: Create a web page animals.html tha
 t has the following input elements:\n\n* A text box for a user name.\n\n* 
 A set of radio buttons for "the animal you are most afraid of" with four s
 uitable choices.\n\n* A dropdown for "your favorite animal" that offers fo
 ur suitable choices. (Use w3schools to figure out how to set up this input
  type.)\n\n* A "Proceed" button. When it is clicked the animals.php script
  should run.\n\nStep 2: Create a PHP script animals.php that gives the inp
 uts back to the user on a new page in a suitable format.\n\nPart Two\n\nYo
 ur task is to create a web-based front end for an INSERT query for the Art
 ist table in the artist/band database in your individual account. If neces
 sary\, re-run the script provided for Assignment 8 to make sure your table
 s are correctly set up.\n\nRefer to [EXAMPLE | Creating the Bands HTML and
  PHP Pages] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/pages/example-%7C-
 creating-the-bands-html-and-php-pages) as a model for this process.\n\nSte
 p 0: Download this script and run it in your individual database  [Assign
 ment51.sql] (https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2204568/files/167821256?wr
 ap=1)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------\n\nStep 1: Create the artist.html file \n-----------------
 -------------------\n\n* The artist.html page should contain a form that w
 ill allow the user to add new data to the artist table.\n\n* Make sure you
  correctly set the action attribute on your form to insertartist.php\n\nSt
 ep 2: Create the insertartist.php file \n--------------------------------
 ---------\n\n* Create the insertartist.php file that takes the data from t
 he artist.html form\, connects to the database\, and successfully inserts 
 the data into the artist table. A message should be displayed to confirm t
 hat the record has been added.\n\nStep 3: Confirm Results in MySQL\n------
 --------------------------\n\n* Log into your MySql account and write a si
 mple select query that proves that your new record has been added to the a
 rtist table. Take a screenshot of the output.\n\n-------------------------
 -\nSubmitting Your Assignment\n--------------------------\n\nThis is an in
 dividual assignment. You may not work with anyone else on this assignment.
  All work must be your own.\n\nSubmit the following on Canvas:\n\n* A text
  file with the full URLs to all files created for this assignment\n\n* You
 r full code for the following files:\n\n* animals.html\n\n* animals.php\n\
 n* artist.html\n\n* insertartist.php\n\n* A file containing the screen sho
 t from Step 3.\n\nMake sure that you submit the Artist files\, not the Ban
 d files that you were given in the example. It should be fairly simple to 
 create the Artist files based on the Band example. You will get zero for t
 his assignment if you submit the Band example.\n\nOnce you have submitted\
 , check that your documents open correctly from Canvas.\n\n---------\nReso

 als.html that has the following input elements:\n\n* A text box for a user
  name.\n\n* A set of radio buttons for "the animal you are most afraid of"
  with four suitable choices.\n\n* A dropdown for "your favorite animal" th
 at offers four suitable choices. (Use w3schools to figure out how to set u
 p this input type.)\n\n* A "Proceed" button. When it is clicked the animal
 s.php script should run.\n\nStep 2: Create a PHP script animals.php that g
 ives the inputs back to the user on a new page in a suitable format.\n\n4 
 of the 20 points available will be based on making your web page(s) look "
 nice".\n\nPart Two (30 points)\n\nYour task is to create a web-based front
  end for an INSERT query for the Artist table in the artist/band database 
 in your individual account. If necessary\, re-run the script provided for 
 Assignment 8 to make sure your tables are correctly set up.\n\nRefer to [E
 XAMPLE | Creating the Bands HTML and PHP Pages] (https://iu.instructure.co

 that takes the data from the artist.html form\, connects to the database\,
  and successfully inserts the data into the artist table. A message should
  be displayed to confirm that the record has been added.\n\nStep 3: Confir
 m Results in MySQL (5) points)\n------------------------------------------
 --\n\n* Log into your MySql account and write a simple select query that p
 roves that your new record has been added to the artist table. Take a scre
 enshot of the output.\n\n--------------------------\nSubmitting Your Assig

 with their mentor and/or instructor.\n\nThis activity aligns with the foll
 owing I308 Course Outcomes:\n\n5. Demonstrate the ability to write advance
 d SQL queries to retrieve data from a SQL database and format the output d
 ata.\n\n------\n Task \n------\n\nYour team task is to write detailed sp
 ecs for your five SELECT queries. Note that your final list of queries may
  require you go back and make changes to your database design and build st
 eps.\n\nRequirements:\n\n      Your team should have five queries in to
 tal:\n\n* All queries must require JOINs\n\n* At least 1 query must utiliz
 e a subquery \n\n* At least 3 queries must utilize aggregation (SUM\, COU
 NT\, etc.) in some form.\n\n* In combination\, queries must exercise all t
 he parts of your database. Don't write queries that are very similar to ea
 ch other.\n\n* Make sure there is  sufficient data in each table of your 
 database to demonstrate that your queries return the appropriate data.\n\n
 * Please use the following format as an example:\n\nNAME OF QUERY: Most Po
 pular Meals\n\nSHOW name-of-meal and number of times ordered for 10 most f
 requently ordered meals\n\nFOR [user-chosen dorm]\n\nQUERY WILL USE: JOIN

 team number and member names are listed. Only team member names that parti
 cipated should be included. Percentages for participation can be used for 
 members. \n\nSubmit a single txt\, doc\, or pdf file with all queries for
  the assignment. Once you have submitted\, check that your document opens 
 correctly from Canvas. If they cannot open it from the computer they are u

 ng basis:\n\n* Is the list of queries in the suggested format?\n\n* Do the
  queries meet the requirements outlined aboves?\n\n* Do the queries reflec
 t the suggestions of the mentor and/or instructor?\n\n9-10 points - Excell
 ent work. Your team is ready to continue to the next step.\n\n7-8 points -
  A good effort. Your mentor will indicate minor changes that you should ma
 ke before proceeding to the next step\n\nless than 7 points - Serious inad
 equacies. You need to contact your mentor and arrange to resubmit this ass
 ignment with the necessary changes before proceeding to the next step. You

 php file \n---------------------------------------\n\nThe page should con
 tain a drop-down list that is populated dynamically from the p_Band table.
  The list should show only the band title and should be ordered by title. 
 Only the band's id should be passed to bandinfo.php.\n\nYour bandselect.ph
 p should run a script that calls bandinfo.php to display the current data
  about the selected band.\n\nStep 2: Create bandinfo.php \n--------------
 --------------\n\nThis page must display the information about the selecte
 d band. This should include as a minimum the year formed\, the names of th

  Analyze/Model\, Database Creation\, Data Manipulation\, and Data Display 
 categories\n\n--------\nPurpose \n--------\n\nThe purpose of this assignm
 ent is to assemble and polish the final version of all the components of y
 our project.\n\nThis activity aligns with all six of the I308 Course Outco
 mes.\n\n----\nTask\n----\n\nYour team Final Project task is to finish your
  final project by turning in a web-based interface for your queries as wel
 l as the final version of the documents you created in the various project
  steps.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* A fina
 l version of your ERD that represents the database as you actually built i
 t.\n\n* The final conversion of your ERD into a logical model.\n\n* A MySQ
 L script containing the final version of the code that you wrote to create
  your database tables and populate them with data.\n\n* A file containing 
 your MySQL code for of all the SELECT statements.\n\n* A file containing a
 ll the html and PHP code that you used to create and run your web page(s).
 \n\n* A .pdf file that describes exactly what each of your queries does an
 d suggests input to provide positive and negative test to demonstrate that
  it works.\n\n* If you did any "special" features\, a .pdf file describing
  what they are and how you implemented them.\n\n* The link to the home pag
 e of your project.\n\n--------------------------\nSubmitting Your Assignme
 nt\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a team assignment that is part o
 f the Final Project assignment group. Please make sure your team number an
 d member names are listed.\n\nOnce you have submitted\, check that your li
 nks open correctly from Canvas.\n\nAbsolutely no late submissions will be 
 accepted. Technology issues do not excuse a late submission. Leave yoursel
 f extra time to make a submission.\n\nSubmit the following files to this C
 anvas assignment to complete your final project:\n------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* A teamXX
 .pdf file that contains your team's final ERD (revised for any changes) an
 d final relational model conversion. This should reflect the final structu
 re of the project as you actually built it. It is highly unlikely that you
  did not revise your ideas as you implemented the project\, so do not just
  resubmit the same ERD and Conversion you submitted previously.\n\n* A tea
 mXX-build.sql file containing the script you used tp build and populate yo
 ur database.\n\n* A teamXX-select.sql file containing your SQL code for of
  all the SELECT statements. The final SELECT statements will be tested by 
 the graders through the PHP scripts that you create and further by running
  them directly in MySQL.\n\n* A teamXX.zip file containing all of your PHP
 /HTML files.\n\n* A teamXX.txt file containing the URL link to where the P
 HP/HTML for your project is located. This can be in an individual team mem
 ber’s account.\n\n* A teamXX.pdf file that contains suggestions for the 
 grader to test your project and describes any special features of your pro
 ject.\n\n--------------\nSpecifications\n--------------\n\nFor a satisfact

 our project. Your instructors will check the range of grades to ensure tha
 t the standard is consistent throughout all teams and sections.\n\nYour pr
 oject will first be graded on product quality\, and by default\, all membe
 rs of a team will receive the same grade. However\, adjustments may be mad
 e for individuals who have contributed significantly more or less to the p
 roject. Each team member must submit the Team Contribution Evaluation\, an
 d this may be used\, in conjunction with your mentor's or instructor's int
 eractions with the team\, to make adjustments to individual grades.\n\nThi
 s assignment will be graded for product quality on the following basis:\n\
 n* Do the ERD and Conversion reflect the database as it was actually built
 \, and does the final version follow all the conventions and standards for
  ERDs established in Modules 1 and 2? \n\n* Were the database tables crea
 ted correctly? Are all primary and foreign keys correctly identified? Are 
 the chosen data types for each column reasonable?\n\n* Is the data created
  to populate the database sufficient to test the correctness of the querie
 s? (Note: Please help out your grader by including suggestions on your web
  page for sample input choices that demonstrate the queries work.) \n\n* 
 Do the SELECT queries run without errors and produce output? \n\n* Do the
  queries meet the standards for including JOINs\, aggregations\, and subqu
 eries? Are the queries submitted what was agreed to in step 5a of the proj
 ect? \n\n* Do all the SELECT queries avoid hard coding and use dynamic dr
 op-downs where appropriate? \n\n* Does the project's html page present th
 e project in a reasonably attractive format? Is the output of the queries 
 presented in suitable tabular format? Do the dropdowns show meaningful val
 ues\, not just ID numbers. \n\n* Is the PHP code correct and error-free?
  \n\n* By completing the items above correctly\, you can receive up to 12
 0 of the 130 points available. If you feel you have done so\, you can atte
 mpt for some or all of the remaining 10 points by adding some "special" fe
 ature that goes beyond the basic requirements. For example\, you could imp
 lement some of the material covered in Module 6. An attractive web page is
  not in iteself a special feature.

DESCRIPTION:---------\n Purpose \n---------\n\nThe purpose of this assign
 ment is to assemble and polish the final version of all the components of 
 your project.\n\nThis activity aligns with all six of the I308 Course Outc
 omes.\n\n----\nTask\n----\n\nYour team Final Project task is to finish you
 r final project by turning in a web-based interface for your queries as we
 ll as the final version of the documents you created in the various projec
 t steps.\n----------------------------------------------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Final
  versions of your ERD and Conversion that represent the database as you ac
 tually built it. (teamxxERD.pdf)\n\n* A MySQL script containing the final 
 version of the code that you wrote to create your database tables and popu
 late them with data. (teamxxBuild.sql)\n\n* A file containing your MySQL c
 ode for of all the SELECT statements.(teamxxSELECT.sql)\n\n* A file contai
 ning all the HTML and PHP code that you used to create and run your web pa
 ge(s). There will be several scripts\, and they must be in a zip file call
 ed teamxxCODE.zip.\n\n* A file that describes exactly what each of your qu
 eries does and suggests input to provide positive and negative test to dem
 onstrate that it works. If you did any "special" features\, this file shou
 ld also describe what they are and how you implemented them. (teamxxNOTES.
 pdf)\n\n* The link to the home page of your project. This should be in the
  text area of the submission.\n\nTen of the 130 points for this assignment
  will be awarded based on any "special features" you have successfully imp
 lemented in your project. Generally\, these are things that we talked abou
 t in class but that you did not get to implement in any of the individual 
 or team assignments. The following is a list of some ideas\; you should di
 scuss these or any other ideas you might have with your mentor and/or inst
 ructor. Points indicated are for full\, successful implementation of the f
 eature\, not just for attempting it. Note that you cannot attempt more tha
 n 10 points total--i.e.\, attempt 20 points and do them all badly in hopes
  of getting 10 points of partial credit.\n\n* Security: Setting up Login/P
 assword security based on a table in your database (4 points) with encrypt
 ed passwords (2 points). Then incorporating a PHP session (4 points).\n\n*
  Creating and using a view (4 points). The view must have a sensible purpo
 se--i.e.\, be useful.\n\n* Having a Return button on the query results pag
 es that takes the user back to the main project page. (2 points)\n\n* Usin
 g input types other than the basic text and dropdowns where they make sens
 e. (1 point each\, up to 4 points max)\n\n* Giving user options to order t
 ailor query results by incorporating choices that can be inserted into the
  executed MySQL query--for example\,sorting or limiting the output (2 poin
 ts each\, up to 4 points max)\n\n* Having a "2-level" query. For example\,
  the main query returns a list of most popular menu items. The user can th
 en select one of these and see details of all purchases of that item. (8 p
 oints)\n\n* If you have other ideas for special features\, discuss these w
 ith your mentor or instructor.\n\n \n\n--------------------------\nSubmit
 ting Your Assignment\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a team assignm
 ent that is part of the Final Project assignment group. Please make sure y
 our team number and member names are listed.\n\nOnce you have submitted\, 
 check that your links open correctly from Canvas.\n\nAbsolutely no late su
 bmissions will be accepted. Technology issues do not excuse a late submiss
 ion. Leave yourself extra time to make a submission.\n\nChecklist of files
  to submit to Canvas:\n---------------------------------------\n\n* teamxx
 ERD.pdf\n\n* teamxxBUILD.sql\n\n* teamxxSELECT.sql\n\n* teamXX.CODEzip\n\n
 * teamxxNOTES.pdf\n\nAdditionally\, the url for your project's main page m
 ust appear in the text area of the assignment submission.\n\n-------------
 --\n Grading Rubric\n\n---------------\n\nYour team mentor will be the pr
 imary grader for your project. It will also be graded independently by a s
 econd TA who has not been involved with your team during the semester. You
 r instructors will check the range of grades to ensure that the standard i
 s consistent throughout all teams and sections.\n\nYour project will first
  be graded on product quality\, and by default\, all members of a team wil
 l receive the same grade. However\, adjustments may be made for individual
 s who have contributed significantly more or less to the project. Each tea
 m member must submit the Team Contribution Evaluation\, and this may be us
 ed\, in conjunction with your mentor's or instructor's interactions with t
 he team\, to make adjustments to individual grades.\n\nThis assignment wil
 l be graded for product quality on the following basis: [Team Project Grad
